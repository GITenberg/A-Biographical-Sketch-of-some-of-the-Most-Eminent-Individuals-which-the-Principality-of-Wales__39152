<p><i>William Baxter</i> was born in Wales in the year
1650.&nbsp; In his eighteenth year he was sent to Harrow School,
when he could speak no other language but Welsh; he, however,
soon acquired English, and triumphantly overcame all these
disadvantages, and at the age of twenty-nine he commenced author,
with the publication of his &ldquo;Analogia Lingu&aelig;
Latin&aelig;.&rdquo;&nbsp; He afterwards was appointed master of
the Mercer&rsquo;s School, in London.&nbsp; He soon made himself
known as an excellent philologist and antiquary, by several
learned works, and more particularly his Horace and his
Dictionary of British Antiquities, entitled &ldquo;Glossarium
Antiquitatum Britannicarum,&rdquo; in which he attempted, from
his knowledge of the British language, to determine geography by
etymology.&nbsp; He died in 1723.</p>
<p><a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span><i>Lewis
Bayly</i>, an eminent prelate, was a native of Caermarthen, and
studied at Oxford.&nbsp; He was appointed chaplain to Henry
Prince of Wales, son of James the First, to whom he dedicated a
religious work, entitled the &ldquo;Practice of Piety,&rdquo;
which has passed through a vast number of editions.&nbsp; He was
rector of St. Matthew&rsquo;s church, in London, and afterwards
bishop of Bangor; and died in 1631.&nbsp; His son,</p>
<p><i>Thomas Bayly</i> was educated for the church at Cambridge;
and during the civil war he resided at Ragland Castle, as
chaplain to the Marquis of Worcester; after the surrender of
which he travelled on the Continent; and on his return to England
he published his &ldquo;Certamen Religiosum, or a Conference
between King Charles the First and Marquis of Worcester,
concerning religion, in Ragland Castle, Anno 1646,&rdquo; which
he is supposed to have written to justify his embracing the Roman
Catholic religion.&nbsp; He also published the &ldquo;Royal
Charter granted to Kings,&rdquo; for which he was committed to
Newgate.&nbsp; He also published another work, entitled
&ldquo;Herba parietis.&rdquo;&nbsp; Having made his escape from
prison, he died in France in 1659.</p>
<p><i>Morris Clynog</i> was a native of Caernarvonshire, and was
educated at Cambridge, where he graduated L.L.B.&nbsp; He was
appointed rector of Corwen sinecure in 1556, and became a
prebendary of York, and an officer in the Prerogative Court,
under Cardinal Pole, <a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
3</span>archbishop of Canterbury, and he was nominated to succeed
Dr. William Glynn in the bishopric of Bangor; but the queen dying
before he was consecrated, he fled beyond sea, and going to Rome
he became, some years after, the first rector of the English
hospital there, after it was converted into a college for English
students, where he became much noted for his partiality to his
countrymen of Wales, which always caused a great faction between
the Welsh and English students resident there.</p>
<p><i>Thomas Coke</i>, the eminent missionary, was the son of a
surgeon at Brecon, in South Wales, where he was born in the year
1747.&nbsp; He was educated at the College school at that town,
and in due time he was entered a Gentleman Commoner of Jesus
College, Oxford.&nbsp; He took the degree of L.L.D. in 1775; and
becoming acquainted with Wesley, he supported his opinions with
great zeal.&nbsp; He commenced his labours as a missionary in
North America in 1784, where he remained for several years in
great popularity with the Methodists; but his advocating the
cause of the negroes, and his opposition to the inhuman traffic
in slaves, brought upon him the indignation of the Americans, and
he was obliged to leave the country with precipitancy, and it was
with great difficulty that he escaped to England.&nbsp; He
afterwards made nine voyages as a missionary to the West Indies
with great success, <a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
4</span>which must be attributed to his pious zeal and learning,
which he has left several works to prove.&nbsp; His character has
always been greatly extolled for the judgment which he exhibited
in very trying periods, and for the amiableness of his
disposition.&nbsp; He died on his voyage to the East Indies in
1814.</p>
<p><i>Francis Davies</i>, D.D., an eminent and pious prelate, was
a native of Wales, and was born in the year 1604.&nbsp; After an
academical education, he entered the church; he received various
preferment, and in 1660 he was appointed archdeacon of
Llandaff.&nbsp; In 1667 he was raised to the bishopric of the
same diocese; and died in 1674.</p>
<p><i>John Davies</i>, D.D., the celebrated Welsh antiquary and
learned divine, was born at Llanverras, in Denbighshire, and was
educated at Ruthin School, under Bishop Parry.&nbsp; He was
entered at Jesus College, Oxford, in 1589, where he
graduated.&nbsp; In 1608, he removed to Lincoln College, and took
his Doctor&rsquo;s degree in 1616.&nbsp; Having been appointed
chaplain to Bishop Parry, he was made canon of St. Asaph by him;
and in 1604, he was presented to the rectory of Mallwyd, and
subsequently to those of Llan yn Mowddy and Darowen; and in 1617
to the prebend of Llannfydd, and subsequently to Llanvor
sinecure.&nbsp; His character was held in high estimation in
Oxford for his proficiency in the Greek and Hebrew languages: <a
name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>a most exact
critic, and an indefatigable searcher of antiquities.&nbsp; His
celebrated works are &ldquo;Antiqu&aelig; Lingu&aelig;
Britannic&aelig; Rudimenta,&rdquo; 8vo., 1621, and
&ldquo;Dictionarium Britannico-Latinum, and
Latino-Britannicum,&rdquo; which was published in London, 1632,
folio.&nbsp; At the end of his dictionary is a good collection of
Welsh proverbs.&nbsp; He died in May, 1644, and was buried in the
church of Mallwydd, Meirionethshire.</p>
<p><i>Miles Davies</i> was a native of Whitford, near Holywell,
in Flintshire.&nbsp; He was originally intended for the church,
but from some unknown cause he left his native country, and went
to London, where he subscribed himself barrister at law.&nbsp;
Here he commenced author, and published three volumes of his
&ldquo;Athen&aelig; Britannic&aelig;,&rdquo; in 1715, which
contain much curious and valuable knowledge.&nbsp; Very little is
now known of his history, but he is supposed to have been
unfortunate in his later career as a literary character.&nbsp; It
is uncertain when his death took place.</p>
<p><i>Richard Davies</i>, D.D., was the son of David ap Gronw,
and was born in Denbighshire, and educated at New Inn Hall,
Oxford.&nbsp; Having entered the church, he became vicar of
Burnham, and rector of Maids-morton, Buckinghamshire, which
preferment he was deprived of in Queen Mary&rsquo;s reign, for
being married; and he consequently retired to the
Continent.&nbsp; On the accession of Queen Elizabeth he returned
home, and <a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
6</span>was raised by her to the bishopric of St. Asaph, in 1559,
from whence he was translated to the see of St. David&rsquo;s in
1561.&nbsp; This eminent prelate was a man of great learning, and
he was employed, with others, in translating the Bible into
English, and he translated all from the beginning of Joshua to
the end of Samuel.&nbsp; He also translated part of the New
Testament into Welsh, particularly some of the Epistles.&nbsp; He
published also some other works.&nbsp; He died at the Episcopal
Palace of Abergwyli, Caermarthenshire, in 1581.</p>
<p><i>Thomas Davies</i>, D.D., Bishop of St. Asaph, was a native
of Llanbeder, near Aberconwy, Caernarvonshire, where he was born
about the year 1515.&nbsp; He received his academical education
at St. John&rsquo;s College, Cambridge.&nbsp; He became rector of
his native parish, and was also made archdeacon of St. Asaph, and
chancellor of Bangor.&nbsp; In 1561 he was advanced to the
bishopric of St. Asaph, where he continued to his death, which
took place in 1573.&nbsp; He was a very pious and charitable
person, and founded a scholarship in Queen&rsquo;s College,
Cambridge.&nbsp; He bequeathed also considerable sums of money
for other pious uses.</p>
<p><i>Walter Devereux</i>, Earl of Essex, the father of the
unfortunate favourite of Queen Elizabeth, was born in
Caermarthenshire in the year 1540, and succeeded his grandfather
in the titles of Viscount Hereford and Lord Ferrers.&nbsp; His
joining the Earl of Lincoln with a <a name="page7"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 7</span>body of troops against the rebels who
rose in the North, recommended him to the favour of Queen
Elizabeth, who created him Earl of Essex in 1572, and made him a
Knight of the Garter.&nbsp; He was afterwards appointed governor
of Ulster in Ireland; and his death, which was supposed to have
been hastened by poison, by his enemy the Earl of Leicester, took
place in Dublin in 1576, leaving the character of a brave
soldier, loyal subject, and disinterested patriot.</p>
<p><i>David Dolben</i> was born at Segrwyd, near Denbigh, in
1581.&nbsp; He was educated at St. John&rsquo;s College,
Cambridge, where he proceeded regularly through his degrees to
that of doctor.&nbsp; He became a prebendary of St. Asaph, and
vicar of Hackney, in Middlesex; and in 1631 he was raised to the
bishopric of Bangor.&nbsp; He died two years after his promotion,
in London, and was buried in Hackney church.</p>
<p><i>William Edwards</i>, one of the most wonderful examples of
self-taught genius, was a native of Glamorganshire, where he was
born at Eglwysilan, in 1719.&nbsp; At an early age he attracted
notice by the neatness of his workmanship, in building walls on
his father&rsquo;s farm; and gradually he arrived at the building
of houses and larger structures.&nbsp; Having given great
satisfaction to all his employers, he undertook, in 1746, to
build a bridge over the river Tav, which was executed and greatly
admired; at the end of two years and a half it <a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>was destroyed
by a tremendous flood, which carried it away: he immediately
commenced a new one, which however was likewise a failure.&nbsp;
The third was completed in 1755, and remains a splendid monument
of his talent, and is one of the most beautiful in the world; its
span is 140 feet; and it exceeds the famed Rialto of Venice,
which was supposed to be the largest arch in the world, by 42
feet.&nbsp; He devised several important improvements in the art
of bridge building, and the success of his last bridge over the
Tav introduced him to public notice; and he was employed to build
numerous other bridges in South Wales.&nbsp; He died in
1789.&nbsp; It is rather singular that his son and grandson were
equally possessed of the same taste and architectural talent.</p>
<p><i>Thomas Edwards</i>, better known by his familiar
appellation of <i>Twm o&rsquo;r Nant</i>, was born at Nant, near
Denbigh, in the year 1739.&nbsp; He received but a poor education
in his youth, and was brought up to no regular trade, but worked
as a labourer; his genius however showed itself at an early age,
and he gave proofs of his Awen in the composition of a peculiar
species of dramatic writing, known in Wales by the name of
&ldquo;Interludes,&rdquo; which were very common there in the
last century.&nbsp; They appear to bear some analogy to the New
Comedy of the Athenians, where he satirizes living persons under
fictitious names; and although <a name="page9"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 9</span>there are numerous examples of low
scurrility and satire, yet they abound with fine strokes of
genuine wit, and excellent poetry.&nbsp; He possessed a command
of language, and was a good writer when he pleased; a neat
specimen of which exists in his Autobiography, in Welsh.&nbsp; He
spent his life in various parts of Wales, in different
occupations, although he esteemed the acting of his Interludes
not the least profitable.&nbsp; He generally bore a part in the
exhibiting of his compositions, and gained considerable profit by
selling printed copies of them, which he hawked about the country
himself.&nbsp; Some of his poetry on various subjects has been
published, and two portraits of him.&nbsp; He was a man of great
muscular power; and he died in 1810, in the seventy-first year of
his age.</p>
<p><i>John Evans</i>, D.D., was born at Wrexham, in Denbighshire,
in 1680.&nbsp; He was an eminent Dissenting divine, and graduated
both at Edinburgh and Aberdeen; he was the author of several most
excellent sermons on the Christian Temper, which have been
admired by divines of every denomination.&nbsp; He for some years
was the minister of the congregation of Independents in Petty
France, having succeeded Dr. Williams; he was also lecturer for
some time at Saddlers&rsquo; Hall; and he died of dropsy in
1732.</p>
<p><i>John Evans</i>, D.D., was born in Llanarmon,
Denbighshire.&nbsp; He received his education at Jesus College,
<a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>Oxford,
where he proceeded through his degrees.&nbsp; Having taken
orders, he obtained the living of Llanaelhaiarn, in
Carnarvonshire, and in 1701 he was promoted to the bishopric of
Bangor, and he was translated thence to the bishopric of Meath,
in Ireland, in 1715.</p>
<p><i>Evan Evans</i>, an eminent divine and poet, better known
among his countrymen by the bardic appellation of Ienan Brydydd
Hir, was born at Cynhawdrev in Cardiganshire, in the year
1730.&nbsp; He received his education at the grammar school of
Ystrad-meurug in the same county, whence he removed to Oxford,
and was entered at Merton College in 1751.&nbsp; After leaving
college he officiated as curate at several places; and applied
himself with great diligence to the cultivation of Welsh
literature, and employed his leisure time in transcribing ancient
manuscripts; for which purpose he visited most of the libraries
in Wales, where manuscripts were known to exist.&nbsp; In the
pursuit of his literary labours he for some time enjoyed the
patronage of Sir Watkin W. Wynne, and Dr. Warren, Bishop of
Bangor.&nbsp; He received an annuity of 20<i>l.</i> from Paul
Panton, Esq., of Plasgwyn, in Anglesea, on condition that all his
manuscripts should on his death become his property; and in
consequence, the whole collection, amounting to a hundred
volumes, was deposited in Plasgwyn Library, where they still
remain.&nbsp; He published <a name="page11"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 11</span>two volumes of Welsh sermons, and was
the author of an English poem, entitled the &ldquo;Love of our
Country;&rdquo; but his chief work which ranked him high as an
antiquary and critic, was a volume of Welsh poems with Latin
translations, prefaced by a learned &ldquo;Dissertatio de
Bardis.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Welsh poems in this volume furnished
Gray with matter for some of his most beautiful poetry.&nbsp; Mr.
Evans was a man of excellent disposition, and great abilities as
a Welsh scholar, but for some reason he never obtained any
preferment in the church.&nbsp; He served in succession the
curacies of Towyn in Meirion, Llanberis, and Llanllechid in
Caernarvonshire.&nbsp; He died suddenly at the place of his
birth, in August, 1789.</p>
<p><i>Richard Fenton</i>, well known as the author of a
&ldquo;Historical Tour through Pembrokeshire;&rdquo; was born in
Wales, and was for several years an eminent member of the Welsh
bar.&nbsp; He was also author of other works which were published
anonymously, of which &ldquo;A Tour in search of
Genealogy,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Memoirs of an Old Wig,&rdquo;
were highly esteemed as works of great interest, and abounding in
wit and anecdote.&nbsp; He was a particular friend of Garrick,
Goldsmith, Glover, and other great wits of the day.&nbsp; He
translated also the works of Athen&aelig;us, which were never
published.&nbsp; He died at an advanced age in November,
1821.</p>
<p><i>John Gambold</i> was born at Haverfordwest about the <a
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>year
1706.&nbsp; He received a liberal education, and was entered at
Christ Church, Oxford, where he took his degree of Master of Arts
in 1734.&nbsp; He was presented to the living of Stanton Harcourt
by Archbishop Secker in 1738, which he resigned ten years after,
from motives of conscience, having become a convert to the
opinions of Zinzerdorf, an account of whose life and character he
published.&nbsp; He was appointed by the Moravians one of their
bishops, of whom he had become a distinguished member in
1754.&nbsp; While at Oxford, he was the author of a &ldquo;Sacred
Drama,&rdquo; which was published in 1740, on the subject of the
martyrdom of Saint Ignatius; and he superintended an edition of
the Greek Testament at the Clarendon press; he translated also a
History of Greenland from the Dutch, besides several sermons and
other productions.&nbsp; He was a man of blameless morals, deep
erudition, and sincere piety; and he was greatly beloved for the
amiableness of his manners.&nbsp; He died at Haverfordwest in
1771.&nbsp; He was author of a &ldquo;Welsh Grammar,&rdquo; and
an able critic in the language.</p>
<p><i>William Glynn</i>, D.D., was born in 1504, at Malltraeth in
Anglesea, and educated at Cambridge, where he became Master of
Queen&rsquo;s College.&nbsp; In 1549, he was presented to the
living of St. Martin&rsquo;s-le-grand, London; and in 1551 he was
made rector of his native parish of Heneglwys, and in 1555 he was
promoted to the episcopal see of Bangor, where he died in 1558,
in <a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>the
fifty-fourth year of his age.&nbsp; Fuller, in his Worthies of
Wales, gives a high character of this excellent bishop; and he
was a man of great natural abilities and learning, and strictly
attentive to the duties of his high station.</p>
<p><i>Edmund Griffith</i>, D.D., was a native of Lleyn in
Caernarvonshire, where he was born in 1570.&nbsp; He was educated
at Brazen-nose College, Oxford, whence he removed to Jesus
College, where he graduated.&nbsp; In 1599, he obtained the
rectory of Llandwrog, and the following year he was made canon of
Bangor; and after other preferments he was made dean of the same
diocese in 1613, and he was promoted to the bishopric in
1633.&nbsp; His death took place in the year 1637.</p>
<p><i>Elizabeth Griffith</i>, who has distinguished herself in
the literary world by several productions, was a native of Wales;
she married an Irish gentleman of the name of Richard Griffith,
and little is known of her except her works.&nbsp; She first
published &ldquo;Letters of Henry and Frances,&rdquo; which is
supposed to contain the genuine correspondence of herself and her
husband before, and for some time after their marriage.&nbsp; She
was the author of several dramas, novels, and several other
productions, which obtained various success.&nbsp; She died in
1793.</p>
<p><i>George Griffith</i>, D.D., was born at Penrhyn,
Caernarvonshire, in 1601.&nbsp; He was educated at Westminster <a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>School, from
whence he was elected student of Christ Church, Oxford, in 1619,
where he became an eminent tutor and preacher.&nbsp; He was
appointed chaplain to Bishop John Owens, and was by him presented
to the rectory of Llanvechain, Montgomeryshire, which he
subsequently left for Llanymynech, and he also had the rectory of
Llandrinio.&nbsp; In 1631, he was made a canon of St.
Asaph.&nbsp; On the commencement of the civil war, he lost his
preferment on account of his attachment to the royal cause, to
which he rendered good service; but on the Restoration he was
rewarded, and raised to the bishopric of St. Asaph.&nbsp; In a
convocation of the clergy in 1662, he was an active member in
drawing up the Act of Uniformity, and making several alterations
in the Liturgy; and he is supposed to have written the form for
the baptism of those of riper years.&nbsp; He was also author of
some Plain Discourses on the Lord&rsquo;s Supper.&nbsp; He died
in 1666.</p>
<p><i>John Gwillim</i> was born of an ancient Welsh family in
Herefordshire, in 1565.&nbsp; He was educated at Brazen-nose
College, Oxford, and became a member of the Herald&rsquo;s
College, London, in which he obtained the appointment of Rouge
Croix Pursuivant, in 1617, which was owing to the appearance of
his famous work, the &ldquo;Display of Heraldry,&rdquo; which
first appeared in 1610, and has since gone through several other
editions.&nbsp; His death took place in 1621.</p>

15</span><i>Matthew Gwinne</i>, M.D., was an eminent physician,
and was the first professor of medicine on Sir Thomas
Gresham&rsquo;s foundation.&nbsp; The exact year of his birth is
uncertain, but he was born in London of Welsh parents; and he
received his education at Merchant Tailors&rsquo; School, whence
he removed to St. John&rsquo;s, Oxford, of which college he
became a fellow.&nbsp; He composed a Masque, which recommended
him to King James the First, before whom it was performed in
Oxford; and he rose higher in that monarch&rsquo;s favour by an
essay which he wrote against tobacco.&nbsp; He was the author of
various other poems and prose works.&nbsp; He died in 1627.</p>
<p><i>John Hanmer</i>, a member of the ancient family of the same
name, living at Hanmer, in Flintshire, was educated at the
University of Oxford, where he obtained a fellowship in All Souls
College.&nbsp; He subsequently became a prebendary of Worcester,
and rector of Bingham, Nottinghamshire.&nbsp; He was appointed
chaplain to King James the First, who nominated him bishop of St.
Asaph in 1623.&nbsp; He died at Pentre-pont, near Oswestry, in
1629; and bequeathed several sums of money for charitable
purposes.</p>
<p><i>Sir Thomas Hanmer</i>, Baronet, was born in 1676, and
succeeded to the title and estates of his uncle Sir John Hanmer,
in Flintshire.&nbsp; He was educated at Westminster School, and
Christ Church, Oxford.&nbsp; He commenced his parliamentary
career in the representation <a name="page16"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 16</span>of the county of Suffolk; and in
1713, he was elected speaker of the House of Commons, which
honourable office he held until the end of his parliamentary
life, which from its commencement lasted upwards of thirty
years.&nbsp; He then withdrew altogether from public life, and
turned his attention to literature; he published an elegant
edition of Shakspeare in six volumes, quarto, which was printed
at Oxford in 1744; and he liberally presented the copyright to
the University.&nbsp; He died at his seat in Suffolk in 1746.</p>
<p><i>Howell Harris</i> was born at Trevecka, in Brecknockshire,
in 1714.&nbsp; His parents were in humble circumstances, but they
contrived to give him a classical education, and kept him at
school until he was eighteen, when his father dying, he was
obliged to support himself by giving instruction to a few boys in
the neighbourhood, intending at a proper time to enter the
established church.&nbsp; In 1735, he went to Oxford, and was
entered at St. Mary Hall, where he did not remain to complete his
studies.&nbsp; In 1739, he began to traverse Wales, preaching in
the open fields and streets according to the tenets which
Whitfield was spreading in England, and gaining numerous converts
every day.&nbsp; The sect which he introduced is still very great
in Wales, and after spending seventeen years in spreading his
doctrine, he came to reside permanently at his native town of
Trevecka.&nbsp; After an active life, he died in the year
1773.</p>
<p><a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span><i>John
ap Henry</i> was born in Wales in 1559, and was a celebrated
character at that period, better known by his assumed title of
Martin Marprelate.&nbsp; He was entered at Peterhouse, Cambridge,
where he took the degree of B.A. in 1584; he afterwards removed
to Oxford, where he graduated M.A.; he preached frequently in
both Universities, and gained great reputation, and he afterwards
became a notorious Puritan.&nbsp; His embracing the principles of
the Brownists, rendered him obnoxious to a vindictive government,
to the cruelty of which he afterwards fell a victim.&nbsp; He was
prosecuted for some libellous pamphlets which could not be proved
against him; and afterwards he was most illegally tried and
condemned on a charge of denying the sovereign&rsquo;s authority,
for which he was accordingly executed.&nbsp; He was a man of
great talent and learning, but his productions are chiefly
political tracts which related to that period.</p>
<p><i>Matthew Henry</i> was the son of Philip Henry, an eminent
Nonconformist, and he was born at Broad Oak, in Flintshire, in
the year 1663.&nbsp; He was early instructed by his father in the
Latin, Greek, and Hebrew languages, in which he made great
proficiency, and being originally intended for the bar, he was
entered at Gray&rsquo;s Inn; but his great predilection for
divinity induced him to leave that profession, and for
twenty-five years he was the zealous pastor of a Dissenting <a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>congregation
in Chester.&nbsp; In 1702, he removed to Hackney, where he paid
the most sedulous attention to the duties of his ministry; he
remained there until his death, which took place in 1714, of a
stroke of apoplexy.&nbsp; His numerous works are a proof of his
deep learning, and he enjoyed great popularity both as an author
and a preacher; his chief work is an Exposition of the Bible, in
five volumes, folio, which has gone through numerous
editions.</p>
<p><i>Edward Herbert</i>, Lord Herbert of Cherbury, eminent for
his character and writings, was the son of Richard Herbert, Esq.,
of a very ancient family, and was born at Montgomery Castle, in
North Wales, in 1581.&nbsp; His proficiency was so great in his
early education that he was entered at University College,
Oxford, at the age of twelve.&nbsp; In 1600, he came to London,
and being introduced at court, he became a Knight of the Bath
soon after the accession of James the First.&nbsp; After spending
his time in visiting various courts of Europe, and serving for
some time under the Prince of Orange in the Low Countries, in
1614, he was sent on an embassy to the court of France; and
having been recalled, he was sent ambassador a second time, and
while there he printed at Paris his famous book &ldquo;De
veritate prout distinguitur a Revelatione.&rdquo;&nbsp; In 1625,
he returned home, and was created an Irish Peer, and afterwards
an English Baron.&nbsp; He afterwards <a name="page19"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 19</span>retired from public life, and upon
the breaking out of the civil war, he joined the parliamentary
party, but he soon quitted it, and joined the royal cause, and
consequently he was a great sufferer in his estate.&nbsp; He died
in London, in 1648, and was buried in St.
Giles&rsquo;s-in-the-fields.&nbsp; He wrote the Memoirs of his
own Life, which were not published until the year 1764, by Lord
Oxford.&nbsp; The character of this distinguished nobleman was
brave, generous, and disinterested.</p>
<p><i>George Herbert</i>, younger brother of Lord Herbert,
distinguished himself as a poet and divine; he also was born at
Montgomery Castle, in 1593.&nbsp; He was educated at Westminster
School, and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he obtained a
fellowship; and in 1619, he was chosen public orator.&nbsp;
Having taken orders, he applied himself with great assiduity to
the duties of his profession, and the first benefice which he
received was a prebend in the diocese of Lincoln, and the parish
church connected with it was rebuilt mostly at his own
expense.&nbsp; He subsequently obtained the rectory of Bemerton,
near Salisbury.&nbsp; His death took place in February,
1633.&nbsp; He published the &ldquo;Country Parson,&rdquo; and he
was the author of the &ldquo;Temple,&rdquo; which contains poems
on sacred subjects, besides other minor pieces.</p>
<p><i>James Howel</i>, the author of the popular and interesting
&ldquo;Epistol&aelig; Hoelian&aelig;,&rdquo; was the son of a <a
name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>clergyman,
and born in Caermarthenshire, in 1596.&nbsp; He took his degree
of bachelor of arts in Jesus College, Oxford, in 1613.&nbsp; When
he left the University, he was appointed, through the interest of
Sir Robert Mansel, to superintend a patent glass manufactory in
London, which had been established by some men of rank.&nbsp; In
1619, he commenced a tour on the Continent in the service of his
employers, and during the three years that he continued abroad,
he visited Holland, Spain, France, and Italy; in Venice he
engaged some workmen for his manufactory, for the Venetians were
at that time very famous for their skill in casting
plate-glass.&nbsp; Soon after his return to England he was
elected fellow of Jesus College, and travelled abroad again with
the son of Lord Altham.&nbsp; He afterwards had the office of
secretary to Lord Scrope, then president of the North, and was
elected member of parliament for Richmond, and subsequently he
was appointed secretary to the English Ambassador, the Earl of
Leicester, in Denmark.&nbsp; In 1640, he was made clerk of the
council, which he did not long retain by reason of
Cromwell&rsquo;s usurpation.&nbsp; His works are numerous, and he
was the first who held the office of Historiographer, which he
obtained on the Restoration.&nbsp; He died in 1666.</p>
<p><i>William Hughes</i>, D.D., was a native of Caernarvonshire,
and was educated partly at Oxford, whence he removed to
Christ&rsquo;s College, Cambridge.&nbsp; He was <a
name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>chaplain to
the Duke of Norfolk, and he took his degrees of divinity in
Oxford, having been incorporated from Cambridge.&nbsp; He was
afterwards rector of Llysfaen in Caernarvonshire, and in 1573, he
was consecrated Bishop of St. Asaph.&nbsp; He died in 1600.</p>
<p><i>Humphrey Humphreys</i>, D.D., was born at
Penrhyn-dau-draeth, Merionethshire, in 1648.&nbsp; He received
his education at the free grammar schools of Oswestry and Bangor,
and in 1665, he was admitted a member of Jesus College, Oxford,
where he obtained a scholarship, and afterwards a fellowship; he
proceeded regularly through his degrees, and became rector of
Llanvrothen, which he left in 1672 for the living of
Trawsfynydd.&nbsp; Having been made a canon of Bangor, he was
installed dean of the same cathedral in 1680, and in 1689, he was
raised to the bishopric, from which he was translated to the see
of Hereford in 1701.&nbsp; His death took place in 1712.&nbsp; He
was a person of excellent virtues during the whole course of his
life, and an example of piety, and strictly attentive to the
duties of his high station.</p>
<p><i>George</i>, <i>Lord Jefferies</i>, <i>Baron Wem</i>, was
the son of John Jefferies, Esq., of Acton, in Denbighshire, where
he was born in the beginning of the seventeenth century.&nbsp; He
received his education at Shrewsbury School, and Westminster, and
was entered at the Middle Temple to study law.&nbsp; His
father&rsquo;s family being <a name="page22"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 22</span>large, his allowance was consequently
very scanty, but his industry and ingenuity supplied all
deficiencies.&nbsp; On commencing his professional career, he was
made a citizen of London through the interest of a relation; and
he was subsequently chosen recorder of the corporation.&nbsp;
This high station recommended him to the notice of the court, and
furthered his advancement.&nbsp; He was appointed successively a
Welsh Judge, and Chief Justice of Chester, and created a
baronet.&nbsp; Having been appointed Chief Justice of the
King&rsquo;s Bench, he was employed to prosecute the adherents of
the Duke of Monmouth, which office he executed with great
cruelty, and for his zeal in this service he was rewarded by the
vindictive and cold-hearted James with the post of Lord High
Chancellor.&nbsp; It is acknowledged, however, that he showed
himself an able and impartial judge in cases which were not
connected with politics.&nbsp; On the accession of William the
Third, he was committed to the Tower, where he died in April,
1689.&nbsp; He was succeeded in his title and estates by his only
son, whose daughter was married to Earl Pomfret; and after his
death, she presented the noble collection, known by the name of
Pomfret marbles, to the University of Oxford.</p>
<p><i>William Lleyn</i> was a very celebrated Welsh bard, and
flourished in the reign of Queen Elizabeth.&nbsp; He was a native
of Llangain in Lleyn, in Caernarvonshire.&nbsp; He excelled all
the bards of his time in sublimity of <a name="page23"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 23</span>thought and poetic fire, and was much
admired for the sprightliness of his wit.&nbsp; His compositions
are remarkable for grave sentences, and maxims of policy and
wisdom.&nbsp; He had a poetical contest with Owain Gwynedd, a
contemporary bard, which is still extant, besides several other
pieces which have never been published.&nbsp; He died at
Oswestry.</p>
<p><i>David Jenkins</i> was born at Hensol, in Glamorganshire, in
1586.&nbsp; He was educated at Edmund Hall, Oxford, and entered
at Gray&rsquo;s Inn.&nbsp; Being called to the bar, he was
subsequently made a Welsh Judge, and continued in this office
until he was taken prisoner by the parliamentary forces at
Hereford, and imprisoned in the Tower of London.&nbsp; Having
rendered himself obnoxious to the parliament, in consequence of
his having condemned, when judge, several who had taken arms
against the King, he was brought before the House of Commons;
whose authority he denied, and called the whole assembly a den of
thieves; being provoked by this language, they voted him guilty
of high treason, and sentenced him to be hanged; on which he
undauntedly observed that he would suffer with the Bible under
one arm and Magna Charta under the other.&nbsp; He escaped
however this punishment, but was fined 1,000<i>l.</i> for
contempt, and his estates were confiscated.&nbsp; He was
committed to Newgate, where he remained until the Restoration;
but it does not appear <a name="page24"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 24</span>that he obtained any reward for his
courage and fidelity from the forgetful Charles.&nbsp; He died in
1667, at Cambridge.</p>
<p><i>Sir Leoline Jenkins</i>, L.L.D., was born in 1623, at
Llantrisaint, in the county of Glamorgan, and was educated at
Jesus College, Oxford.&nbsp; When the civil war broke out, he
took arms for the King, and upon the failure of the royal cause
he left the kingdom.&nbsp; On the Restoration he returned to
Jesus College, and was elected fellow, and in 1661, he became the
principal.&nbsp; He was afterwards admitted an advocate at
Doctors&rsquo; Commons; and with other eminent civilians he was
appointed to review the maritime laws, and to compile a body of
rules for the adjudication of prizes, which became the standard
of the Court of Admiralty.&nbsp; He was made judge of the same
court in 1665, and in 1668, of the Prerogative Court in
Canterbury.&nbsp; He was likewise sent on an embassy to the
Dutch.&nbsp; On his return he was chosen member for the
University of Oxford, sworn of the privy council, and appointed
secretary of state, which office he resigned in 1684.&nbsp; On
the accession of James, he was again elected member for Oxford,
but was prevented by ill health from sitting in that parliament,
and died in 1685.&nbsp; His letters and papers were collected and
published by W. Wynne, in two folio volumes; and all his estate
was bequeathed by him for charitable uses, and chiefly to Jesus
College.</p>
<p><a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
25</span><i>Thomas Johnes</i> was born of an ancient Welsh family
in Ludlow, in 1748.&nbsp; He was educated at Eton, and Jesus
College, Oxford, where he proceeded to his Master&rsquo;s
degree.&nbsp; He was the proprietor of the estate of Havod, in
Cardiganshire, where he built a splendid mansion, and occupied
himself there in planting trees, and otherwise improving his
property.&nbsp; He also devoted himself to literary pursuits, the
fruits of which are elegant editions of the &ldquo;Chronicles of
Froissart and Monstrelet,&rdquo; and several other works, all of
which he himself translated from the French, and printed at his
own establishment at Havod.&nbsp; He first obtained a seat in
parliament for the borough of Cardigan, and afterwards for the
county of Radnor; he was likewise auditor for Wales, and colonel
of the Caermarthenshire militia.&nbsp; In 1807, his library,
consisting of the finest typographical productions, and
containing a number of valuable Welsh manuscripts, was burnt in a
fire which nearly destroyed the whole house.&nbsp; He died in
1816.</p>
<p><i>Edward Jones</i>, D.D., was born near the town of
Montgomery, and was educated at Westminster School, whence he was
elected to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he was chosen fellow
in 1667.&nbsp; He became master of Kilkenny College, and dean of
Lismore, in Ireland, and was made bishop of Cloyne, and in 1692
he was translated to the see of St. Asaph.&nbsp; His translation
<a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>to this
diocese was entirely owing to his being a native of the
country.&nbsp; He died at Westminster in 1703.</p>
<p>[For an account of Edward Jones, Bardd y Brenin,&mdash;see
<i>Addenda</i>.]</p>
<p><i>Owen Jones</i>, the distinguished Welsh antiquary, whose
name will be ever associated with the Welsh language, was born in
Llanvihangel Glyn-y-myvyr, Denbighshire, in 1741.&nbsp; In early
life he removed to London, and entered the employment of an
eminent furrier, whom he eventually succeeded.&nbsp; Being
enthusiastically interested in the antiquities of his native
country, he devoted a great portion of his time to the collecting
of Welsh manuscripts; and the result of his disinterested
patriotism has been the publication of the &ldquo;Archaiology of
Wales,&rdquo; in three volumes, entirely at his own
expense.&nbsp; He also procured transcripts of ancient Welsh
poetry, amounting to fifty volumes, quarto, which invaluable
collection is now deposited in the Cymmrodorion Library, in
London.&nbsp; He published the works of the famous poet, Davydd
ap Gwilym, and also &ldquo;Dihewyd y Cristion.&rdquo;&nbsp; In
1772, Mr. Jones, formed the Gwyneddigion Society, for the purpose
of patronizing the Bards of Wales, and promoting the study of the
Welsh language; and this excellent society annually offers prize
medals, and other rewards for compositions on various
subjects.&nbsp; After a most useful and active life, <a
name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>this amiable
man, whose zeal was only equalled by his private worth, died at
his house in Thames-street, London, September, 1814, in the
seventy-third year of his age.</p>
<p><i>Inigo Jones</i>, whose proper name was Ynyr, which in his
travels in Italy, he Italianized into Inigo, was born at
Llanrwst, Denbighshire, about the year 1572.&nbsp; Being
originally destined for a mechanical employment, he emerged from
obscurity by dint of talent, which recommended him to the Earl of
Pembroke, a great patron of the fine arts, who also supplied him
with the means of visiting Italy, for the purpose of studying
landscape painting.&nbsp; While at Venice, the works of Paladio
inspired him with a taste for architecture, in the practice of
which he arrived at unrivalled excellence.&nbsp; His reputation
recommended him to the notice of Christiern the Fourth, King of
Denmark, who bestowed on him the post of first architect.&nbsp;
Having returned to England, he was appointed architect to the
Queen, and Prince Henry, and afterwards to the Board of
Works.&nbsp; His acknowledged taste in classical architecture
obtained for him sufficient employment from court, and many of
the nobility and gentry, so that he realized a handsome
fortune.&nbsp; Many proofs exist of the elegant taste of this
great architect; and he was also commissioner for the repairing
of St. Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral, all of which was ruined by the
great fire; <a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
28</span>but it was subsequently rebuilt after Jones&rsquo;s
original design.&nbsp; During the civil war he was forced to pay
a fine on account of his known attachment to the royal family;
and being distressed at the ruin of the royal cause, and worn
down with suffering and old age, he died in July, 1652.&nbsp; He
was a good geometrician, and well skilled in various branches of
literature and science; but as an author he only published a
curious treatise, to attempt to prove that Stonehenge was a Roman
temple.</p>
<p><i>John Jones</i>, L.L.D., an eminent divine and philologist,
was a native of Caermarthenshire.&nbsp; He was educated at the
Dissenting College of Hackney; and he became tutor in several
Dissenting academies successively in Wales and England.&nbsp; He
finally settled in London, where he spent his time in editing his
numerous works; among the most popular of which are his
&ldquo;Greek and English Lexicon,&rdquo; and his
&ldquo;Grammar,&rdquo; both Greek and Latin, besides other works
on education; and he likewise was held in great esteem as a
private tutor.&nbsp; He died in London in 1827.</p>
<p><i>William Jones</i>, an eminent mathematician, was born in
the Isle of Anglesey in 1680.&nbsp; At a very early age he
applied himself diligently to the study of mathematics; and in
his twenty-second year he published a &ldquo;Compendium of the
Art of Navigation,&rdquo; which was much approved of.&nbsp; He
began his career in teaching <a name="page29"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 29</span>these sciences on board of a
man-of-war; and he was present at the capture of Vigo.&nbsp; On
his return to England, he gave instructions in the mathematics in
London, and having attracted the notice of some influential men,
he was appointed by Lord Hardwicke secretary of the peace.&nbsp;
He enjoyed the friendship of the great mathematicians and writers
of the age, among whom were Newton, Halley, Head, and Dr.
Johnson.&nbsp; He was member of the Royal Society, and then
vice-president.&nbsp; He was author of several valuable papers on
mathematics, which were published in the Philosophical
Transactions.&nbsp; He died of a polypus in the heart in July,
1749.</p>
<p>Sir <i>William Jones</i>, the celebrated oriental scholar, was
the son of the subject of the preceding article, and was born in
London, September, 1746.&nbsp; He received his early education at
Harrow School, where he was sent in his eighth year.&nbsp; He
very soon attracted the notice of the masters by his splendid
genius; and in 1764, he was entered at University College,
Oxford.&nbsp; While here, he supported, at his own expense, a
native of Aleppo, for the purpose of acquiring the true
pronunciation of the Arabic.&nbsp; And having undertaken the
office of tutor to Lord Althorpe, he went with him to the German
Spa, where he perfected himself in the German language; and on
his return, he distinguished himself by translating the
&ldquo;Life of Nadir Shah&rdquo; into French, <a
name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>which
language he wrote with much elegance.&nbsp; He obtained a college
fellowship, and afterwards entered himself as a law student in
the Temple.&nbsp; In 1772, he published some poems, and in the
same year was elected a fellow of the Royal Society; and in 1774,
he was called to the bar; about two years after, he was made
commissioner of bankrupts.&nbsp; In the mean time, he published
several works, chiefly in oriental literature, which excited the
admiration of the world; and at the same time he was advancing
rapidly in professional reputation.&nbsp; In an election for the
University of Oxford he offered himself as a candidate, where,
however, though respectably supported, he did not succeed.&nbsp;
On the accession of the Shelburne administration, he obtained
what had long been the summit of his ambition&mdash;the
appointment of Judge in the Supreme Court of Judicature in
Bengal, to which he was nominated in 1783, and received the
honour of knighthood.&nbsp; He married Miss Shipley, the daughter
of the Bishop of St. Asaph; and in the same year he arrived at
Calcutta.&nbsp; While in India, he wrote numerous translations
from the Hindostanee, and formed there a society, similar to the
Royal Society of London, of which he was chosen the first
president.&nbsp; He next undertook to compile a complete digest
of the Hindoo and Mohammedan laws, which was not however
completed by him.&nbsp; In 1794, he was seized with an
inflammation of the <a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
31</span>liver, and died on the 27th of April, in the
forty-eighth year of his age.&nbsp; Few men have died more
respected and lamented than Sir William Jones: his genius and
profound learning had attracted the praise of all; and as a
linguist, he has not been surpassed, for he knew no less than
twenty-nine languages, and most of them critically.&nbsp; All his
works were collected and published by his widow, in six volumes,
quarto.</p>
<p><i>Lloyd</i>, <i>Lord Kenyon</i>, was born in Gredington,
Flintshire, in 1732.&nbsp; He was the second son of a gentleman
of independent fortune, and was originally intended to be brought
up as a solicitor, and he was under the instruction of an eminent
lawyer at Nantwich.&nbsp; In consequence of the death of an elder
brother, he was entered at the Middle Temple, and after being
called to the bar, he attended various circuits before he
obtained any practice, which caused him to despair of succeeding
in his profession, and think of applying himself to divinity, and
taking orders.&nbsp; Active attention, however, and indefatigable
industry, brought him at length to notice and extensive
practice.&nbsp; He confined himself afterwards entirely to the
Court of Chancery, where he obtained the most distinguished
celebrity, although he ranked high as a common lawyer.&nbsp; He
conducted the defence of Lord George Gordon, when he was tried
for high treason.&nbsp; In 1780 he was appointed Lord Chief
Justice of Chester, and he twice filled the <a
name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>office of
Attorney-general.&nbsp; On the death of Sir John Sewell, he
accepted the office of Master of the Rolls, and in 1788 he
succeeded Lord Mansfield as Lord Chief Justice of the
King&rsquo;s Bench, where he gave the greatest satisfaction by
his integrity and able administration of justice.&nbsp; He died
in 1802, in his seventieth year.</p>
<p><i>David Lloyd</i>, L.L.D., was born at Llanidloes,
Montgomeryshire, in the year 1603.&nbsp; He was entered at the
age of fourteen at All Soul&rsquo;s College, Oxford, where he
afterwards became a fellow.&nbsp; Having taken orders, he
obtained the rectory of Trevdraeth, in Anglesea, in 1641, which
he resigned on his presentation to Llangynhaval in the following
year, and became successively vicar of Llanvair, in Dyfryn Clwyd,
and warden of Ruthin, and prebendary of Chester; out of all of
which he was ejected after the breaking out of the civil war, and
for his loyalty he was a great sufferer.&nbsp; On the accession
of Charles the Second, he was restored to his benefices, and
promoted to the deanery of St. Asaph in 1660.&nbsp; He was
esteemed an ingenious man, and a good poet; and he published
several pieces which were prized for their wit.&nbsp; He died at
Ruthin in September, 1663.</p>
<p><i>David Lloyd</i>, M.A., was born at Trawsvynydd,
Merionethshire, in 1635, and educated at Ruthin School.&nbsp; He
removed thence to Oriel College, Oxford, <a
name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>where he
graduated, and obtained a college living.&nbsp; He subsequently
retired to Wales, where he was appointed chaplain to Bishop
Barrow, who, besides other preferment, gave him a canonry in the
diocese of St. Asaph.&nbsp; He was afterwards vicar of Northop,
where he resided for several years; he published several works,
of which the principal are &ldquo;Worthies of the World,&rdquo;
1665, octavo; &ldquo;Memories of Statesmen and Favourites of
England,&rdquo; octavo.&nbsp; He was zealous and industrious in
the discharge of his clerical duties, and esteemed by all for his
charitable disposition.&nbsp; On finding his health decaying, he
retired to the place of his nativity, where he died in 1691.</p>
<p><i>Henry Lloyd</i> was the son of a clergyman in Wales, where
he was born in 1729.&nbsp; His early education he received from
his father, who instructed him in the classics and
mathematics.&nbsp; Being intended for the army, he went abroad,
and was at the battle of Fontenoy; he afterwards travelled in
Germany, and resided in Austria for some years, where he was
appointed aid-de-camp to Marshal Lascy, and received higher
promotion.&nbsp; In 1760 he commanded a large detachment of
cavalry and infantry, which was destined to observe the motions
of the Prussians.&nbsp; He executed this service with great
success; but soon after, for some reason, he threw up his
commission in disgust.&nbsp; He was next employed by the King of
Prussia, and <a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
34</span>served in two campaigns until the peace.&nbsp; On the
breaking out of the war between the Turks and Russians, he
offered his services to Catherine the Second, who made him a
major-general, and he greatly distinguished himself at the seige
of Silistria in 1774, and subsequently he had the command of
30,000 men in the war with Sweden.&nbsp; After his return to
England, he published several works on military tactics, which
are highly thought of, and placed him in a high rank as a
military writer.&nbsp; He died at Huy, in the Netherlands, in

<p><i>Hugh Lloyd</i>, D.D., was a native of South Wales, where he
was born in the year 1589, and having been brought up for the
church, and having received an University education, he became
rector of Llangatoc, in Breconshire, and archdeacon of St.

where he was born in 1638.&nbsp; He was entered at Merton
College, Oxford, whence he removed to Jesus College, where he
graduated, and of which in time he became prebendary.&nbsp; He
also discharged the office of vice-chancellor in that University
with great satisfaction, and was held in high esteem for his
piety and learning.&nbsp; In 1686 he was promoted to the
bishopric of St. David&rsquo;s, but by reason of ill health he
removed to Oxford, and died at Jesus College in 1687.</p>
<p><i>Nicholas Lloyd</i>, an eminent divine, and philological
writer, was born in Flintshire in 1634.&nbsp; He received his
education at Winchester School, and Wadham College, Oxford, where
he obtained a fellowship.&nbsp; He was for some years rector of
Newington Butts, near London, to which he had been appointed by
the Bishop of Worcester, to whom he was chaplain.&nbsp; He died
there in 1680.&nbsp; He published an excellent and highly
esteemed &ldquo;Historical and Geographical Dictionary,&rdquo; in
Latin, which has been the basis of many similar compilations.</p>
<p><i>William Lloyd</i>, D.D., an eminent prelate, was the son of
the Rev. Richard Lloyd, Rector of Tilehurst, <a
name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>Berks, who
came from Henblas, in Anglesea, and was born at his
father&rsquo;s living in 1627.&nbsp; At the early age of eleven
he was entered at Oriel College, Oxford, whence he removed to New
College, and subsequently to Jesus College, where he became
successively a scholar and fellow.&nbsp; Having taken orders in
1648, he was presented to the rectory of Bradfield, Berks, in
1654, which he afterwards resigned.&nbsp; He was appointed

After various other preferment, he was advanced to the bishopric
of St. Asaph in 1680.&nbsp; He was one of the seven bishops who
were committed to the Tower for subscribing and presenting a
petition to King James, deprecating his assumed power of
suspending the laws against popery.&nbsp; Bishop Lloyd having
heartily concurred in the Revolution, was appointed lord almoner
to King William, and in 1692 he was translated to Lichfield and
Coventry, and thence in 1699 to Worcester.&nbsp; His writings,
which relate to history and divinity are greatly prized, and are
distinguished for the learning and acute judgment exhibited in
them.&nbsp; He died in 1717.</p>
<p><i>William Lloyd</i>, D.D., was a native of Wales, and was
educated at St. John&rsquo;s College, Cambridge, and graduated
there.&nbsp; Having taken orders, he obtained <a
name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>various
preferment, and in 1675 he was made bishop of Llandaff, from
whence he was translated to Peterborough in 1679, and thence in
1685 to the see of Norwich, out of which he was ejected for not
taking the oath to King William and Queen Mary.&nbsp; He retired
to Hammersmith, near London, where he died in 1710.</p>
<p><i>Edward Llwyd</i>, M.A., an eminent British antiquary and
naturalist, was a native of Cardiganshire, where he was born
about 1670.&nbsp; At the age of seventeen, he was entered at
Jesus College, Oxford, where he graduated.&nbsp; He succeeded Dr.
Plot, the keeper of the Ashmolean Museum, and applied himself
with great diligence to the study of the language of the early
Britons, and for that purpose he travelled in the countries where
it still remained.&nbsp; After having visited Ireland, Scotland,
Cornwall, and Bretagne, and making himself perfect in the various
dialects, he published the results of his accurate observations
in the &ldquo;Arch&aelig;ologia Britannica,&rdquo; which was the
first volume of a series on a great plan, which he did not live
to carry on; and his death taking place before the ample
materials which he had provided were properly arranged for the
press, the whole of his manuscripts were sold to Sir Thomas
Sebright, but not before Jesus College and the University had
refused to purchase them.&nbsp; They subsequently came to the
possession of Colonel Johnes, of <a name="page38"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 38</span>Havod, and were mostly burnt in the
fire which nearly destroyed that gentleman&rsquo;s mansion.&nbsp;
He died in 1709.&nbsp; He was also author of &ldquo;Lithophylacii
Britannici Ichnographia,&rdquo; and a catalogue of the
manuscripts in the Ashmolean Museum, besides several papers
published in the Philosophical Transactions.</p>
<p><i>Humfrey Lloyd</i>, M.A., a learned antiquary and historian,
was born in the town of Denbigh in 1527.&nbsp; He was entered a
gentleman commoner of Brazen-nose College, Oxford, where he
graduated in 1551, and studied medicine.&nbsp; He returned to his
native place, where he practised his profession, and also
represented it in parliament.&nbsp; He was highly esteemed by
Camden, and the geographer Ortelius, to whom he addressed his
&ldquo;Commentarioli Britannic&aelig; descriptionis
fragmentum,&rdquo; published at Cologne in 1572.&nbsp; He also
translated Caradog of Llancarvan&rsquo;s &ldquo;History of
Cambria,&rdquo; which was edited by Dr. Powel, in 1584, quarto,
and he was author of a letter &ldquo;De Mon&acirc; Druidum
Insul&acirc; antiquitati su&aelig; restitut&acirc;.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He died in 1568.</p>
<p><i>Christopher Love</i>, an eminent Presbyterian divine, was
born at Caerdiff, in 1618.&nbsp; He was originally intended for
trade, and was apprenticed in London; but his father was
persuaded afterwards to give him an University education, and
accordingly he was entered at New-Inn Hall, Oxford, where he
proceeded in due order to his degrees of bachelor and master of
arts, <a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>and
entered the church.&nbsp; Upon his refusal to subscribe to the
canons which were enjoined by Archbishop Laud, he was expelled
the congregation of masters.&nbsp; Upon the establishment of the
Presbyterian government, he was ordained to preach at St.
Mary&rsquo;s, Aldermanbury; and he was one of the commissioners
appointed by parliament at the treaty of Uxbridge.&nbsp; He was
one of the London ministers who signed a declaration against
putting the King to death, and subsequently he took an active
share in a conspiracy to place Charles the Second on the throne,
which was detected by the vigilance of Cromwell; and Mr. Love was
tried, and beheaded on Tower-hill in August, 1651.</p>
<p><i>Richard Lucas</i>, D.D., an excellent divine, and classical
scholar, was born at Presteign, Radnorshire, in 1648.&nbsp; He
received an University education at Jesus College, Oxford, where
he graduated.&nbsp; In 1683 he was elected by the parishioners to
the lectureship of St. Olave&rsquo;s, Southwark, and the vicarage
of St. Stephen&rsquo;s, Coleman-street.&nbsp; He obtained
afterwards a stall in Westminster, which he held for nineteen
years.&nbsp; His writings consist of sermons and various other
theological works.</p>
<p><i>Francis Mansel</i> was the third son of Sir Francis Mansel,
of Muddlescomb, Caermarthenshire, where he was born in
1588.&nbsp; He was educated at Hereford School, and Jesus
College, Oxford.&nbsp; He became a fellow of All <a
name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>Souls, and in
1620 he was elected principal of Jesus College.&nbsp; He was
ejected from his office at the parliamentary visitation in 1648,
and he retired to Wales, where he assisted the royal cause with
his greatest exertions, and consequently exposed himself to the
persecutions of the parliamentary party.&nbsp; He was a very
great benefactor to his college, and considerably increased its
revenues, and he obtained besides for it a valuable
library.&nbsp; He died in May, 1665.</p>
<p><i>Henry Maurice</i>, D.D., an eminently learned and talented
divine, was born in 1648, at Llangristiolus, in Anglesea.&nbsp;
He was sent to Jesus College, Oxford, in his sixteenth year,
where his abilities and great merit recommended him to the notice
of the principal, Sir Leoline Jenkins, who made him a scholar of
the college, and afterwards fellow.&nbsp; When Sir Leoline was
sent on an embassy to Cologne, he appointed Mr. Maurice to be his
chaplain, in which station he gave the greatest satisfaction by
his diligent attention to his duties; and on his return to
England, he became acquainted with Dr. Lloyd, afterwards bishop
of St. Asaph, who recommended him to Archbishop Sancroft, and he
was appointed his chaplain, and soon after rector of Newington,
and prebendary of Chichester.&nbsp; He published some treatises
against popery; and in 1691 he was elected Lady Margaret&rsquo;s
professor of <a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
41</span>divinity in Oxford.&nbsp; He died suddenly in 1693, at
Newington.&nbsp; It was observed when Dr. Maurice was appointed
chaplain to the Archbishop, that several of the highest offices
in church and state had been filled by Welshmen.&nbsp; Dr. Dolben
was Archbishop of York, Dr. Lloyd Bishop of St. Asaph, Sir George
Jefferies Lord Chancellor, Sir Leoline Jenkins Secretary of
State, Sir Thomas Jones Lord Chief Justice, Sir John Trevor
Master of the Rolls, and Sir William Williams Speaker of the
House of Commons.</p>
<p><i>Thomas Maurice</i>, the celebrated orientalist, was a
member of a respectable Welsh family.&nbsp; On the death of his
father, who had been a master in Christ&rsquo;s Hospital for
twenty-six years, Thomas, the eldest of six children, was
admitted on the foundation there, but he was afterwards removed
to various seminaries in the country for the benefit of his
health; the last of which was the celebrated one of Dr.
Parr&rsquo;s, at Stanmore-hill.&nbsp; At the age of nineteen he
was entered at St. John&rsquo;s College, Oxford, whence he
subsequently removed to University College, and here he commenced
author at an early period, by publishing a translation of
&ldquo;Sophaclis &AElig;dipus Tyrannus,&rdquo; which gained him
great credit; this was soon followed by some other pieces of
verse and prose.&nbsp; On taking orders, he obtained the curacy
of Woodford, in Essex, and afterwards he purchased a chaplaincy
in the ninety-seventh <a name="page42"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 42</span>regiment.&nbsp; In 1783 he commenced
the arduous undertaking of his &ldquo;History of India,&rdquo;
the various volumes of which appeared successively at different
times&mdash;the last in 1804.&nbsp; He was presented by Earl
Spencer to the vicarage of Wormleighton, in Warwickshire, in
1799; and the appointment of assistant librarian to the British
Museum was also bestowed upon him; and in 1804 he was presented
to the living of Cudham, Kent, by the Lord Chancellor.&nbsp; He
died at his rooms in the Museum, March 30th, 1824.&nbsp; Besides
his great works on India, he was the author of numerous poems,
dissertations, and other miscellanies, all of which ranked him
high as a literary character.</p>
<p><i>Rowland Meyrick</i>, L.L.D., was born at Bodorgan, in
Anglesea, in 1505.&nbsp; He was educated at Oxford, where he
subsequently became principal of New-Inn Hall; and after holding
various preferments, he was advanced to the bishopric of Bangor
in 1559, where he died in 1565.</p>
<p><i>Sir Hugh Middleton</i>, well known as the maker of the New
River, London, was the son of Richard Middleton, Esq., governor
of Denbigh Castle, under Edward the Sixth, Mary, and
Elizabeth.&nbsp; Having settled in London as a goldsmith, he made
several successful speculations in some mines in Cardiganshire,
and became an alderman.&nbsp; Observing the scarcity of good
water in London, he took entirely upon himself to <a
name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>supply the
metropolis with a stream of pure water; for the corporation, with
all its wealth, conceiving the undertaking to be too difficult,
refused to have any share in it.&nbsp; He, however, patriotically
persevered; and after almost the ruin of his own fortune, he
succeeded in obtaining assistance from the King for a share, and
it was completed.&nbsp; The water was let in before an immense
concourse on Michaelmas-day, in 1613.&nbsp; He was knighted, and
in 1622 he was created a baronet.&nbsp; His death took place in
1631.</p>
<p><i>Robert Morgan</i>, D.D., was born at Llandysilio,
Montgomeryshire, in 1608.&nbsp; He was entered at Jesus College,
and thence he removed to St. John&rsquo;s College, Cambridge,
where he graduated.&nbsp; Having taken orders, he became chaplain
to Bishop Dolben, who preferred him, in 1632, to the vicarage of
Llanwnog, Montgomeryshire, and rectory of Llangynhaval.&nbsp; He
was afterwards prebendary of Chester, vicar of Llanvair,
Denbighshire, and rector of Trevdraeth, and Llandyvnan, in
Anglesea; out of all which he was ejected during the usurpation
of Cromwell, during which he was a great sufferer for his
loyalty.&nbsp; In 1660 he was restored to his benefices, and was
promoted to the archdeaconry of Meirioneth; and in 1666 he was
raised to the bishopric of Bangor.&nbsp; He died in 1673, and was
buried in his cathedral, which had been greatly improved at his
cost.</p>
<p><a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
44</span><i>William Morgan</i>, D.D., the first translator of the
Bible into the Welsh language, was born at Penmachno,
Caernarvonshire, and was educated at St. John&rsquo;s College,
Cambridge.&nbsp; He was vicar of Welsh-pool, in Montgomeryshire,
and obtained other preferment.&nbsp; Having occasion to go to
London to see Archbishop Whitgift, his grace conceived a high
opinion of his abilities, and appointed him his chaplain.&nbsp;
At the Archbishop&rsquo;s desire, he undertook a translation of
the Bible into Welsh, which was published in 1588, black letter,
folio.&nbsp; The New Testament was only corrected by him from a
translation by William Salusbury, a Denbighshire gentleman, who
first published the Epistles and Gospels for the whole year, in
Edward the Sixth&rsquo;s time.&nbsp; Queen Elizabeth rewarded Dr.
Morgan with the bishopric of Llandaff, in 1595, and he was
translated to the see of St. Asaph in 1601.&nbsp; He died in
1604.</p>
<p><i>Hugh Morris</i>, one of the first of Welsh poets, was born
at Pont-y-Meibion, in Denbighshire, in the year 1622.&nbsp; Being
a younger son, he was apprenticed by his father, who was a
respectable freeholder, to a tanner in Flintshire.&nbsp; He did
not carry on his trade, but lived a life of retirement in the
cultivation of his talent for poetry, of which he has left us
splendid memorial.&nbsp; The productions of his pen are numerous;
and these valuable poems have been patriotically collected <a
name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>and published
by an eminent Welsh scholar and divine, in two volumes.&nbsp;
Hugh Morris, on the breaking out of the civil war, was a stanch
friend to royalty, and he exerted all the powers of his pen in
its support, and there is no doubt but that his writings had
great influence over the minds of the common people, ever
attached to poetry.&nbsp; His satirical poems, where he lashes
the religious cant and vile hypocrisy of the times, are
unequalled for the keen wit and cutting irony, which he handles
in so masterly a manner.&nbsp; He was universally esteemed for
his great abilities and excellent character, and always exercised
his influence in behalf of justice and benevolence, and in the
furtherance of religion.&nbsp; He died at the place of his birth
in 1709, in the eighty-seventh year of his age.</p>
<p><i>Lewis Morris</i>, an eminent poet and antiquary, was born
in the Isle of Anglesea in the year 1702.&nbsp; In his youth he
received but a slender education; but, however, he and three
other brothers, through self-instruction, and cultivation of
their natural talent, became eminent characters in various
branches of knowledge and science.&nbsp; He was chiefly employed
in the service of government; and in 1737 he was appointed by the
admiralty to survey the coast of Wales, which he accomplished
with great satisfaction, and an account of it was published in
1748.&nbsp; At the same period he had the appointment of the
surveyorship of the crown lands <a name="page46"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 46</span>in Wales, and in 1750 he had the
additional offices of superintendent and agent of the
King&rsquo;s mines in the principality.&nbsp; He was a very good
poet in his native language, and several of his productions have
been published.&nbsp; As an antiquary he was eminently skilful,
and it is greatly to be lamented that a valuable work entitled
&ldquo;Celtic Remains,&rdquo; which he left in manuscript, has
never been sent to the press, as his acute and learned remarks
would be a great addition to illustrate our national
antiquities.&nbsp; He collected about eighty volumes of Welsh
manuscripts, which are now deposited in the Welsh School Library,
in London.&nbsp; He died in 1765, in Cardiganshire.</p>
<p><i>Goronwy Owen</i>, A.M., was born about the year 1722, at
Llanvair Mathavarn Eithav, in Anglesea.&nbsp; His parents being
in a humble condition, were not able to bestow upon him a proper
education in his youth, but his great abilities and industry
overcame every obstacle.&nbsp; He was at a respectable seminary
at Pwllheli, where he became second master, and from thence he
removed to Oxford.&nbsp; He was ordained deacon in 1745, and for
a short time he held the curacy of his native parish, where he
enjoyed great happiness among his friends and early
acquaintances.&nbsp; He was obliged to resign this, to make room
for a friend of the bishop&rsquo;s chaplain, who had appointed
him to it, and this took place with the bishop&rsquo;s
sanction.&nbsp; He next removed <a name="page47"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 47</span>to the neighbourhood of Oswestry, and
soon after he was appointed curate of Oswestry.&nbsp; In the year
1748, he became curate of Donington, in Shropshire, where he kept
also a school in order to add to his small income, and support an
increasing family.&nbsp; Here he composed &ldquo;Cowydd y
Varn,&rdquo; one of his most celebrated pieces; and what portion
of time he could spare from the drudgery of school-keeping, he
spent in the study of Hebrew, Arabic, Syriac, and Chaldee.&nbsp;
In 1733 he removed to the curacy of Watton, in Lancashire.&nbsp;
His great desire was to obtain even the smallest preferment in
any part of his native country, but he was disappointed and
neglected; and in 1755 he resigned his curacy and went to London,
where his countrymen had an intention of building a Welsh church,
and to which he was to be appointed minister.&nbsp; When this
plan did not succeed, he became curate of Northold, where he
remained two years, when an offer was made to him of preferment
in America; and by the assistance of the Cymmrodorion in London,
he crossed the Atlantic, to St. Andrew&rsquo;s, in Virginia; here
he settled for some time, but afterwards removed to New
Brunswick, and from thence to Williamsburg.&nbsp; The time of his
death is not well known.&nbsp; This talented man was one of the
greatest poets that ever appeared among the Welsh, and his
poetical works were printed, with other productions, in a volume,
under the title of &ldquo;Diddanwch Teuluaidd.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
48</span><i>Henry Owen</i>, an eminent divine and philologist,
was the son of a gentleman of fortune, in Merionethshire, where
he was born, at Tanygader, in 1716.&nbsp; He was educated at
Ruthin Grammar school, from whence he removed to Jesus College,
Oxford.&nbsp; He originally intended to practise physic, but
entered into orders, and after various preferment, he became
rector of St. Olave, Hart-street, London, and vicar of Edmonton,
Middlesex.&nbsp; His numerous works consist chiefly of
theological subjects, and he edited &ldquo;Xenophon&rsquo;s
Memorabilia,&rdquo; &ldquo;Critical Disquisitions,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Critica Sacra, or Hebrew Criticism.&rdquo;&nbsp; He also
furnished several papers to the &ldquo;Archaiologia.&rdquo;&nbsp;
His death took place in 1795.</p>
<p><i>John Owen</i>, the celebrated epigrammatist, was a native
of Caernarvonshire.&nbsp; He was educated at Winchester School,
and New College, Oxford, where he graduated L.L.D., and became a
fellow.&nbsp; He afterwards held the mastership of a
grammar-school, near Monmouth, whence he removed to a similar
situation in Warwick.&nbsp; While here, he distinguished himself
by his skill in Latin poetry, and more particularly
epigrams.&nbsp; This talent, however, did great harm, for he was
struck out of the will of a rich uncle for his satirical epigrams
on the church of Rome.&nbsp; He died in 1622, and he was buried
in St. Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral, at the expense of Archbishop
Williams, by whom he was supported in the latter part of his
life.&nbsp; His epigrams <a name="page49"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 49</span>have been several times reprinted,
both in England, and on the Continent; they are justly admired
for their wit and purity of language.</p>
<p><i>John Owen</i>, D.D., the most eminent of Nonconformist
divines in this country, was descended of a respectable family in
North Wales, though born at Stadham, in Oxfordshire, in 1616, of
which place his father, a native of Wales, was vicar.&nbsp; He
was educated at Queen&rsquo;s College, Oxford, where he was
supported by a rich uncle, living in North Wales; but who, being
a royalist, was offended at his nephew&rsquo;s principles, and
died without leaving him anything.&nbsp; On the breaking out of
the civil war, he sided with the parliament, and became a
Presbyterian in his religious opinions; and his display of
Arminianism, which was published in 1642, so recommended him to
the prevailing party, that he was presented to the living of
Fordham, in Essex, and subsequently by the Earl of Warwick, at
the request of the parishioners, to that of Coggeshall, in the
same county.&nbsp; Having now acquired great celebrity, and
become acquainted with General Fairfax during the seige of
Colchester, he was appointed to preach at Whitehall the day after
the execution of Charles the First.&nbsp; He soon after became a
favourite with Cromwell, whom he accompanied on his expeditions
to Ireland and Scotland; and in 1651 he was appointed to the
deanery of Christ Church, Oxford, on which <a
name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>appointment
he received his doctor&rsquo;s degree, and in 1652, Cromwell
being chancellor, Owen was made his vice-chancellor, which office
he held for five years.&nbsp; On the death of his patron, the
Protector, he was deprived of his office and deanery, through the
influence of the Presbyterian party, whom he had offended by
adopting the Independent mode of worship, which he thought more
conformable to the New Testament; and he published his reasons
for thinking so, in two volumes, quarto.&nbsp; On the
Restoration, his merit was so highly appreciated, that Lord
Clarendon offered him immediate preferment if he would conform,
which he respectfully declined.&nbsp; This eminent man died at
Ealing, Middlesex, in 1683.&nbsp; His works, which are of high
Calvinistic principles, are very numerous, amounting to seven
folio, twenty quarto, and thirty octavo volumes.</p>
<p><i>John Owens</i>, D.D., was the son of Owen Owens, of
Bodsilin, in Caernarvonshire, the last archdeacon of
Anglesea.&nbsp; He was born at Burton Latimers, Northamptonshire,
where his father was rector, and was educated at Jesus College,
Cambridge, of which he became a fellow, and succeeded to his
father&rsquo;s living in 1618.&nbsp; He was appointed chaplain to
Charles the First, when he was Prince of Wales, who, on the
supposition that he was a Welshman, which he was in every respect
excepting the place of his nativity, preferred him to <a
name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>the bishopric
of St. Asaph in 1629.&nbsp; This excellent prelate was
distinguished for his incomparable skill in the Welsh language,
and for his pious zeal in promoting the good of his
diocese.&nbsp; He was the first who established there preaching
in Welsh, and laid out great sums of money in new building and
beautifying several parts of his cathedral, and especially in the
erection of an organ.&nbsp; Upon the breaking out of the civil
war, he was a great and extraordinary sufferer; and he died near
St. Asaph, 1651, and was buried under the episcopal throne, when
the church was used as a stable for horses and oxen.&nbsp; He was
author of &ldquo;Herod and Pontius Pilate reconciled.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Lewis Owen</i>, who distinguished himself by his writings
against the Jesuits, was born in Meirionethshire in 1572.&nbsp;
He went abroad, and entered the Society of Jesuits in Spain, but
being disgusted at their behaviour and principles, he withdrew
from them, and made use of the information which he had gained in
exposing them in his works, which are the &ldquo;Running
Register.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Unmasking of all popish
priests,&rdquo; &amp;c., and &ldquo;Speculum Jesuiticum,&rdquo;
which abound in details to their disadvantage.&nbsp; He died in
1631.</p>
<p><i>Morgan Owen</i>, D.D., was a native of South Wales, and was
educated at Oxford, where he graduated.&nbsp; Having taken
orders, he obtained various preferment, and in 1640 he was
installed bishop of Llandaff.&nbsp; On <a name="page52"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 52</span>the breaking out of the civil war, he
retired to Glasallt, Caermarthenshire, and was a very great
sufferer on account of his loyalty.&nbsp; On receiving the news
of the death of his patron, Archbishop Laud, he died suddenly
soon after he heard it, in 1645, and he was buried in the same
county.</p>
<p><i>John Humphreys Parry</i>, an ingenious antiquary, and one
of the most pleasing and learned writers of the present age, was
born at Mold, in Flintshire, in 1787, and his father was rector
of the neighbouring parish of Llanverras.&nbsp; After an
University education, he became a member of the Temple in 1807,
and in due time he was called to the bar in 1810.&nbsp; He
obtained considerable reputation in his profession, and gained
great praise by the publication of the &ldquo;Cambro
Briton,&rdquo; in three volumes, which appeared periodically, and
the value of which was greatly enhanced by his valuable and
judicious notes; he was the author also of the &ldquo;Cambrian
Plutarch,&rdquo; and several prize essays.&nbsp; He was appointed
the editor of the transactions of the London Cymmrodorion, a
volume of which appeared under his auspices.&nbsp; His native
country sustained a great loss by his death, which took place in
1825, in a most melancholy manner: a drunken man knocked him down
in the street; he fell with his head against the pavement, and
was killed upon the spot, leaving a wife and five children
unprovided for.</p>
<p><a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
53</span><i>Richard Parry</i>, D.D., was born at Ruthin,
Denbighshire, in the year 1578, and was educated at Westminster
School, under Camden, from whence he was elected a student of
Christ Church, Oxford; at the age of nineteen, he became
chancellor of Bangor, vicar of Gresford, and then dean of
Bangor.&nbsp; On the accession of James the First, who had a high
opinion of his learning, he nominated him to the bishopric of St.
Asaph in 1604.&nbsp; He was a prelate of great learning and
piety; and he revised the Bible which was translated by Dr.
Morgan, and published a second edition in 1620, which is now the
standard of the Welsh translation of the Bible.&nbsp; He founded
a scholarship in Jesus College, Oxford, to be held by one who has
been educated at Ruthin School, where he was the second who held
the mastership after its foundation by Dean Goodman.&nbsp; He
died at Diserth, near St. Asaph, in September, 1623.</p>
<p><i>Thomas Pennant</i>, the celebrated antiquary and
naturalist, was born at Bychton, in Flintshire, in the year
1726.&nbsp; He studied at Queen&rsquo;s College, Oxford, and he
afterwards removed to Oriel, which he left without taking a
degree.&nbsp; Being of an active and talented mind, he imbibed
early a taste for natural history; and the first effort of his
pen appeared in an account of an earthquake which was felt at
Downing, and it was published in the &ldquo;Philosophical
Transactions.&rdquo;&nbsp; In <a name="page54"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 54</span>1754 he was elected a fellow of the
Antiquarian Society, and in 1757, at the instance of the great
Linn&aelig;us, he was also elected fellow of the Royal Society at
Upsal.&nbsp; He published the first edition of his &ldquo;British
Zoology&rdquo; in 1761.&nbsp; He soon after visited the
Continent, where he became intimate with Buffon, Pallas, and
several other distinguished naturalists.&nbsp; In 1768 a new
edition of the British Zoology appeared, and it was successively
followed by his other works on Natural History, and &ldquo;Tours
in Scotland and Wales.&rdquo;&nbsp; In 1790 was published his
&ldquo;Account of London,&rdquo; which was received with great
avidity, and rapidly passed through several editions.&nbsp; His
works are very numerous, and will ever remain a lasting proof of
his splendid talents, both as an accurate observer of nature, and
diligent antiquary.&nbsp; Several of his works were translated
into German, and other Continental languages; and he was
frequently consulted by the great naturalists of his time, and
his opinions recorded in their publications.&nbsp; His accounts
have always been looked upon as most authentic; and he holds the
first rank as a writer from the popular and interesting style of
his narrative, and his incomparable skill in the selection of
subjects for illustration.&nbsp; He may be esteemed as one of the
greatest patrons of the art of engraving, for upwards of one
thousand plates were used in the embellishment of his
works.&nbsp; He <a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
55</span>ended an active and useful life at the family seat of
Downing, near Holywell, in December, 1798.</p>
<p><i>Sir Thomas Picton</i>, a British general, was born at
Poyston, Pembrokeshire, in 1758.&nbsp; Having entered the army,
he served with great reputation in the West Indies; and his skill
and gallantry were conspicuously displayed in a long service of
forty-five years, both there, and in the marshes of Holland, and
in the peninsula of Spain and Portugal.&nbsp; On the morning of
the battle of Waterloo, he fell gloriously leading his division
to a charge of bayonets, by which one of the most serious attacks
made by the enemy was defeated.&nbsp; After his death a wound was
discovered, which he had received two days before, and which he
heroically concealed, having dressed it himself only with a piece
of torn handkerchief.&nbsp; He died greatly lamented, and his
meritorious life was distinguished for his zeal in the service of
his country.</p>
<p><i>Henry Parry</i> was born in Flintshire.&nbsp; He was
educated at Gloucester Hall, Oxford, where he took his degrees in
arts, and his degree of B.D., at Jesus College, in 1597.&nbsp; He
travelled much abroad, and on his return, he obtained the rectory
of Rhoscolyn, in Anglesea, in 1601, and in 1612 he was installed
canon of Bangor.&nbsp; He died in 1617.&nbsp; He augmented and
published a &ldquo;Welsh Rhetoric, or Egluryn Fraethineb,&rdquo;
which was originally written by William Salusbury, and is
commended by Dr. Davies.</p>

56</span><i>Hester Lynch Piozzi</i>, was the daughter of John
Salusbury, of Bodvel, in Caernarvonshire.&nbsp; She was a
distinguished authoress, and well known as a friend of Johnson,
who made a Tour in Wales on a visit to her.&nbsp; She was first
married, in 1763, to Mr. Thrale, member of parliament for
Southwark, and after his death, she became the wife of Signor
Piozzi, a Florentine.&nbsp; Her works are rather numerous, but
the best known perhaps are her &ldquo;Anecdotes of
Johnson,&rdquo; with whom she was a great favourite until her
second marriage.&nbsp; She died a widow, at Clifton, in 1821, at
a very advanced age.</p>
<p><i>David Powel</i>, D.D., was a native of Denbighshire.&nbsp;

the livings of Rhiwabon and Llanvyllin, and became a prebendary
of St. Asaph; in 1584 he was appointed chaplain to Sir Henry
Sidney, then president of Wales.&nbsp; His first work,
&ldquo;Caradog&rsquo;s History of Wales,&rdquo; quarto, appeared
in 1584, which had been partly translated from the Welsh by
Humphrey Llwyd, and was finished by Powel, who illustrated it
with annotations.&nbsp; This was followed in the following year
by &ldquo;Pontici Virunii Historia Britannica,&rdquo;
octavo.&nbsp; He was also author of &ldquo;De Britannica Historia
recte intelligenda Epistola ad Gul. Fleetwood, Civ. Lond.
Recordatorem.&rdquo;&nbsp; He is said to have undertaken the <a

of a Welsh Dictionary, but he died before it was completed, which
event took place in 1598.</p>
<p><i>John Price</i> was born of Welsh parents in London, in the
year 1600.&nbsp; He was educated at Westminster School, and
Christ Church, Oxford, whence he removed to Florence, having
become a Catholic, and he was there admitted doctor of civil
law.&nbsp; He held the appointment of keeper of the ducal cabinet
of medals and antiquities, and subsequently he became professor
of Greek at Pisa.&nbsp; He was a very ingenious and learned
critic, as his &ldquo;Commentaries on the New Testament&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Notes on Apuleius&rdquo; testify.&nbsp; He died at a

several mathematical, statistical, and political works; and for
one of them he was presented with a gold snuff-box, containing a
vote of thanks by the corporation of London.&nbsp; He was also
fellow of the Royal Society, in whose Transactions he wrote
several papers.&nbsp; He died in 1791.</p>

of &ldquo;Histori&aelig; Britannic&aelig; Defensio,&rdquo;
quarto, which was written in answer to Polydore Virgil, and was
published after his death by his son, in 1573.&nbsp; He was one
of the King&rsquo;s council in the court of the marches, and was
one of the commissioners employed by Henry the Eighth, to survey
the monasteries that were to be dissolved.&nbsp; He died in
1553.</p>
<p><i>Robert Price</i>, D.D., an eminent prelate, was the son of
Colonel Price, of Rhiwlas, in Meirionethshire, where he was
born.&nbsp; He was educated at Christ Church, Oxford, and after
taking orders, was for some time vicar of Towyn, in
Meirionethshire, and afterwards chancellor of the diocese of
Bangor.&nbsp; He was promoted to the bishopric of Ferns, in
Ireland; and on the death of Bishop Roberts, in 1665, he was
nominated to succeed him in the see of Bangor; but his death took
place before his election was completed, and he was buried in the
cathedral church of St. Patrick, Dublin.</p>
<p><i>Rees Prichard</i>, the celebrated author of &ldquo;Canwyll
y Cymry,&rdquo; was born at Llanymddyvri, Caermarthenshire.&nbsp;
At the age of eighteen, he was entered at Jesus College, Oxford,
in 1597, and graduated B.A. in 1602, and obtained the vicarage of
his own parish.&nbsp; In 1613 he was instituted to the rectory of
Llanedy, in the diocese of St. David&rsquo;s; and he was chaplain
to <a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>the
Earl of Essex.&nbsp; In the following year he was made prebendary
of the collegiate church of Brecon, and in 1626 chancellor of St.
David&rsquo;s.&nbsp; As long as the Welsh language endures, will
the memory of Prichard be kept with gratitude; and few
productions ever caused such a profitable and rapid change in
improving the morals of his countrymen.&nbsp; He died in
1644.</p>
<p><i>Edmund Prys</i>, M.A., a distinguished Welsh poet, was born
in the year 1541.&nbsp; After an academical education, he entered
the church, and in 1572 he was made rector of Festiniog, and in
1576 archdeacon of Meirioneth.&nbsp; In 1602 he obtained a
canonry in St. Asaph.&nbsp; He was a very learned man, and
particularly distinguished himself by an elegant metrical version
of the Psalms, which is still in use.&nbsp; There are also extant
fifty-four controversial poems between the Archdeacon and a
contemporary Bard, William Cynwal, both holding a high rank in
the first class of the Welsh poets of that age.&nbsp; It is also
said that Cynwal fell a victim to the poignancy of the
Archdeacon&rsquo;s satire.&nbsp; The last poem of the fifty-four
is a most pathetic elegy, composed by Prys when the news of his
rival&rsquo;s death reached him; he was also an elegant Latin
poet, and a specimen of his talent is prefixed to Dr.
Davies&rsquo;s Welsh and Latin Grammar.&nbsp; He died at
Maentwrog about the year 1622.</p>
<p><a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
60</span><i>Abraham Rees</i>, D.D., the author of the well known
Cyclop&aelig;dia, which bears his name, was born at Montgomery,
in 1743.&nbsp; His father being a Dissenting minister, placed him
first under Dr. Jenkins, of Caermarthen, and subsequently at the
Hoxton Academy, where his brilliant talents and rapid progress
procured his being appointed at an early age mathematical tutor
to the institution, and afterwards resident tutor, which place he
retained for twenty-two years.&nbsp; He then removed, and became
resident tutor of the Natural Sciences at the Dissenting Academy
at Hackney, in 1786.&nbsp; He was minister of a Dissenting
congregation in St. Thomas&rsquo;s, Southwark, and in the Old
Jewry.&nbsp; He was a fellow of the Royal and Linnean Societies,
and he obtained his doctor&rsquo;s degree in Edinburgh, at the
express recommendation of the illustrious Robertson, the
historian.&nbsp; He was author of some other works, besides the
valuable and learned &ldquo;Cyclop&aelig;dia.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
died in June, 1825, in his eighty-second year.</p>
<p><i>John Davydd Rhys</i>, M.D., an eminent grammarian, was born
in the Isle of Anglesea, in 1534.&nbsp; He was educated at Christ
Church, Oxford, and entered the medical profession; he removed to
Sienna, where he took his doctor&rsquo;s degree.&nbsp; While
there, he greatly distinguished himself by his skill in the
Italian language, the fruits of which are &ldquo;De Italic&aelig;
lingu&aelig; pronunciatione,&rdquo; which was printed in Padua,
and &ldquo;Rules for <a name="page61"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 61</span>obtaining the Latin tongue,&rdquo;

history, was born at Rhiwabon, Denbighshire, in 1760.&nbsp; He
was educated at the Grammar-school of St. Asaph, and removed
thence to Trinity College, Dublin, where his abilities soon
became conspicuous.&nbsp; He applied himself to the study of
astronomy and the oriental languages; and at one time it was
supposed that he would have succeeded Dr. Usher, as professor of
astronomy in that University.&nbsp; He became afterwards private
tutor to several noblemen and gentlemen of rank; and in 1800, was
published, his &ldquo;Harmony of the Epistles,&rdquo; a work of
exceedingly high character and labour, which the University of
Cambridge printed at their own expense.&nbsp; Having been
presented to the living of Llanarmon, he dedicated his leisure
time to the elucidation of the antiquities of his native
country.&nbsp; The fruits of his labours in this department are
well known&mdash;&ldquo;Collectanea Cambrica,&rdquo; &ldquo;Early
History of the Cymry,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Cambrian Popular
Antiquities.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was presented also with the living
of Madely, in Shropshire, by Lord Crew.&nbsp; The living of
Llanarmon he subsequently exchanged for the rectory of Halkin,
Flintshire, where he died in 1819.&nbsp; As an excellent <a
name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>critic in his
native language, and equally so in Hebrew and Rabbinical
learning, his works are a sufficient proof; and his
&ldquo;Letters to Volney&rdquo; show to advantage the depth of
his reasoning powers and scientific acquirements.</p>
<p><i>William Roberts</i>, D.D., was a native of Denbighshire,
where he was born in 1585.&nbsp; He was educated at Queen&rsquo;s
College, Cambridge, where he became fellow, and subsequently

successive parliaments.&nbsp; He was educated at Westminster
School, and the University of Glasgow, whence he subsequently
removed to Clare Hall, Cambridge, and in 1776 he took the degree
of bachelor of divinity at that University.&nbsp; Having given
offence by declaring some Whiggish principles in a sermon, which
destroyed all his prospects of promotion, and fearing some
obstacles when he proceeded to his doctor&rsquo;s degree, he
removed to Jesus College, Oxford, where he took it in 1794.&nbsp;
He was presented to the living of Narberth and Lanpeter.&nbsp; As
an author, the greater portion of his works consisted of poetry,

quarto.&nbsp; He was appointed clerk of the council to King
Edward the Sixth, who bestowed upon him, though a layman, a
prebend in St. Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral, and a living in
Wales.&nbsp; On the accession of Queen Mary, he was deprived of
his office and benefices, which treatment is supposed to have
instigated him to join in the rebellion of Sir Thomas Wyatt, for
which he was arrested, and being convicted, was executed at
Tyburn.&nbsp; He was also author of several less important
works.</p>
<p><i>William Thomas</i>, D.D., was a native of South Wales,
where he was born in 1613.&nbsp; He was educated at Jesus
College, Oxford, where he proceeded through his degrees.&nbsp;
Having taken orders, he became vicar of Penbryn, in the time of

Oxford; he was afterwards a canon of Wolsey&rsquo;s New College
of Christ&rsquo;s Church, whence he was ejected on account of his
religious principles, which were liberal, and according with the
doctrines of Luther, who began to flourish at that time.&nbsp; He
took a degree in Cambridge, whither he had removed from Oxford;
but his opinions becoming known, rendered him obnoxious to some
of the dignitaries, and being reprimanded, he thought it prudent
to retire to the Continent, in order to publish his translation
of the Testament, which appeared in 1526, and was printed at
Antwerp.&nbsp; He commenced afterwards the translation of the
Pentateuch, and some other books of the Old Testament; but his
first publication, of which a second edition was widely diffused
over England, caused him to be marked as a victim to Popish
bigotry.&nbsp; Henry the Eighth employed <a
name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 68</span>a man to
betray him to the Emperor, and by his decree he was burnt as a
heretic at Augsburgh in 1536.&nbsp; He was author of some other
works; and his Testament hath by many eminent divines been
declared never to have been surpassed in clearness, and noble
simplicity of style.</p>

natural abilities as well as learning; he was chiefly known from
some curious &ldquo;Treatises on Alchymy and Judicial
Astrology,&rdquo; to which, although a clergyman, he seems to
have been devoted.&nbsp; According to Wood&rsquo;s Athen&aelig;
Oxonenses, he had sense enough not to publish them in his in own
name, but under the assumed name of Eugenius Philalethes; they
are, <a name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

in 1771, besides some sermons.&nbsp; He was rector of Llandochan,
in Glamorgan, and died in the year 1797.</p>
<p><i>Daniel Williams</i>, an eminent theological writer, and
Presbyterian divine, was a native of Wrexham, in <a
name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 71</span>Denbighshire,
where he was born in 1644.&nbsp; Not having received an education
in his earlier youth, he made up the deficiency by his unwearied
diligence and application; and devoting himself to the study of
divinity, he was, at the age of nineteen, ordained a preacher
among the Presbyterians.&nbsp; After officiating in various parts
in England, he went to Ireland as chaplain to the Countess of
Meath, and presided over a congregation in Dublin, where he
continued for twenty years; and married a lady of an honourable
family, and a considerable estate.&nbsp; He subsequently removed
to London, where he was chosen minister of a congregation of
Presbyterians in Bishopsgate-street; and in 1701, having become a
widower, he married a second wife, who survived him.&nbsp; His
learning and piety being held in great esteem, he was honoured
with the diploma of D.D. by the Universities of Edinburgh and
Glasgow; and he bequeathed estates for the support of six
Presbyterian students in the latter.&nbsp; His library, together
with a sum of money for its increase, was left by him, with the
liberal view of founding a public library in London, and which
led to the establishment of the celebrated Red cross street
Institution, which was opened in 1729.&nbsp; He died in 1716, and

London.&nbsp; While in the metropolis, he distinguished himself
by numerous publications on education and morality.&nbsp; He left
his ministerial office among the Dissenters, and becoming
sceptical with regard to the Christian religion, he opened in
1776, a chapel for the celebration of public worship, on the
principles of natural religion, in Margaret-street,
Cavendish-square.&nbsp; The novelty of the institution at first
attracted the curiosity of the public, but it was finally closed,
and the lecturer turned his attention to private tuition.&nbsp;
He has obtained great and deserved reputation as being the
founder of the Literary Fund.&nbsp; He died in June, 1816.&nbsp;
Among his numerous works, several of which have been translated
into German, is a valuable &ldquo;History of
Monmouthshire,&rdquo; in two volumes, quarto.</p>
<p><i>Edward Williams</i>, whose bardic appellation was Iolo
Morganwg, was a native of Glamorganshire, where he was born in
March, 1745.&nbsp; His father being a stone-mason, brought him up
to the same trade; but even in his early youth he was remarkable
for avoiding all diversions with boys of his own age, and was
pensive and thoughtful, eager in receiving the instructions of an
excellent mother, who grounded him well in the <a
name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 73</span>English
language.&nbsp; In 1770, on the death of his mother, he left
Wales, and travelled over several counties in England, in the
exercise of his calling, and studying architecture and other
sciences connected with it.&nbsp; He resided for several years in
London, Bristol, and other towns, and returned to Wales, where he
married in 1781.&nbsp; His first productions were Welsh poetry,
and he was a man of wonderful abilities as a Welsh and English
poet, and a skilful antiquary; he wrote English with great ease
and elegance.&nbsp; In 1794 he published two volumes of English
poetry, which consist of original compositions, and translations
from the Welsh, and in conjunction with Dr. Pughe and Mr Owain
Jones, edited the &ldquo;Myvyrian Archaiology.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
has left several valuable works in manuscript, especially
materials for a History of Wales, which it is greatly to be
lamented was not published in his lifetime.&nbsp; He died on the
17th of December, 1827, aged eighty-two.</p>
<p><i>Griffith Williams</i> was a native of Caernarvon, in North
Wales, where he was born in the year 1589.&nbsp; He was educated
at Jesus&rsquo; College, Cambridge, and having taken orders, he
was appointed to the lectureship of St. Peter&rsquo;s, Cheapside,
but his preaching so offended the Puritans, that they procured
his suspension.&nbsp; He obtained a living in Wales, and became
chaplain to the King, prebendary of Westminster, and dean of <a
name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 74</span>Bangor.&nbsp;
In 1641 he was created bishop of Ossory; and his death took place
at Kilkenny.&nbsp; He was the author of several works on
divinity.</p>
<p><i>John Williams</i>, Archbishop of York, and Lord Keeper of
the Great Seal, was born at Aberconwy, in 1582.&nbsp; He was
educated at Ruthin School, and St. John&rsquo;s College,
Cambridge, where he soon distinguished himself by his application
and splendid abilities, which were rewarded with a
fellowship.&nbsp; He was ordained in 1609, and soon after he
obtained the rectory of Grafton, in Northamptonshire.&nbsp; Being
appointed chaplain to Lord Ellesmere, then Lord Chancellor, he
ingratiated himself so much with his patron by his talents, that
he obtained through him rapid preferments, and was appointed one
of the royal chaplains.&nbsp; In 1619 he was made dean of
Salisbury, and soon after exchanged it for the deanery of
Westminster; in a short time he was appointed lord keeper, and
immediately afterwards he was raised to the bishopric of
Lincoln.&nbsp; He retained great influence at court during the
reign of James the First, and was the chief cause of the
promotion of Laud to the episcopal bench, who, however,
ungratefully joined in various persecutions to which the
Archbishop was subjected for several years; but his worth and
excellent character prevailed: he was restored to favour, and in
1641 he was raised to the archiepiscopal see of York.&nbsp; <a
name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 75</span>During the
civil war, he fortified Conwy Castle for the King&rsquo;s use;
but after a seige, being surprised, he was compelled to give it
up on honourable terms to the parliamentary troops.&nbsp; He died
at Gloddaeth, near Conwy, on his birth-day, in 1650.&nbsp; He was
the author of several theological works, and an interesting
&ldquo;History of his Life&rdquo; was published by Bishop Hacket,
who had been his chaplain; and a more condensed biography
subsequently by Stephens, and also by Phillips.</p>
<p><i>John Williams</i>, L.L.D., was born at Llanbedr-pont
Stephen in 1727.&nbsp; He was educated at the Grammar School of
the same town, where he acquired a competent knowledge of the
classics; being strongly inclined to the ministry, he was entered
at the age of nineteen at a Dissenting Academy, in Caermarthen,
where he went through the usual studies to be qualified for the
office of a minister.&nbsp; In 1752 he went to Stamford,
Lincolnshire, at the unanimous request of a congregation of
Protestant Dissenters, and in 1755 he removed to a similar
situation in Berkshire.&nbsp; Here he completed his
&ldquo;Concordance to the Greek New Testament,&rdquo; and
afterwards he removed to Sydenham, where he officiated for the
long period of twenty-eight years.&nbsp; In 1777 he was chosen
the curator of Redcross-street Library; and the lease of his
chapel expiring, he retired to Islington, where he remained until
his death, which took place in 1798.&nbsp; In his character, both
public and <a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
76</span>private, he was esteemed for the conscientious discharge
of his duty as a Christian minister, and for his literary
acquirements.&nbsp; He published several works on theology and
other subjects, which are of great merit, and enriched with
valuable information.</p>
<p><i>Roger Williams</i> was a native of Wales, where he was born
in the year 1599.&nbsp; He was entered for the church, and was
accordingly educated for it; but adopting puritanical principles,
he emigrated to North America, where he founded the town of
Providence.&nbsp; He distinguished himself by his zeal for the
conversion of the Indians to Christianity, of whose language he
published a very useful &ldquo;Manual and Glossary,&rdquo; which
has been frequently reprinted.&nbsp; His colony thrived rapidly,
as he was decidedly opposed to all restraint in religion, and
granted to all who settled there free liberty of
conscience.&nbsp; He died in 1683.</p>
<p><i>Thomas Williams</i> was a native of Caernarvonshire, and
received an University education at Oxford.&nbsp; He practised as
a physician at Trevriw, near Llanrwst, and he wrote a
&ldquo;Welsh and Latin,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Latin and Welsh
Dictionary,&rdquo; which he left in manuscript; and it was
subsequently published in 1632, with many additions and
corrections by Dr. John Davies.&nbsp; He made a good collection
of pedigrees, which he entitled &ldquo;Priv achau holl Gymru
Benbaladr,&rdquo; i.e. The Primitive <a name="page77"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 77</span>Pedigrees of all Wales.&nbsp; In 1606
he was proceeded against as a Papist in the court of Bangor, and
in the following year he was excommunicated.&nbsp; There was
written also by him a large &ldquo;List of Plants&rdquo; in
Latin, Welsh, and English.</p>
<p><i>William Williams</i> was a native of the Isle of
Anglesea.&nbsp; He was educated at Oxford, and in 1652 he was
elected scholar of Jesus&rsquo; College, whence he removed to
Gray&rsquo;s Inn.&nbsp; In 1667 he was appointed recorder of the
city of Chester.&nbsp; When the Popish plot broke out, he sided
with the party then dominant; and in 1678 he was chosen one of
the representatives of the City of Chester, and again for the
parliament which sat in 1679, and a third time in 1680; in the
two last parliaments he was chosen speaker of the House of
Commons.&nbsp; After the Presbyterian plot broke out in 1683, he
became an advocate for them and the fanatics.&nbsp; When James
the Second came to the crown, he was taken into favour, and was
made solicitor-general instead of Sir Thomas Powis, who was
appointed attorney-general in 1687.&nbsp; Williams was knighted
on this occasion, and soon afterwards created a baronet.&nbsp; He
has published several of his eloquent speeches, besides some
other works.</p>
<p><i>Richard Wilson</i>, the eminent landscape painter, was the
son of the Rev. John Wilson, rector of Penegoes, in
Montgomeryshire, where he was born in <a name="page78"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 78</span>1714.&nbsp; Having received a good
classical education, he was sent at the age of fifteen to London,
where he was apprenticed to a portrait painter: and he set up for
himself in London, and painted the portraits of the Prince of
Wales and Duke of York, who were then under the tuition of Bishop
Hayter, of Norwich.&nbsp; Not obtaining any great success in the
metropolis, he went to Italy, and meeting with the Earl of
Dartmouth, who saw the young painter&rsquo;s great abilities,
proposed that he should travel with him to Naples, which being
readily accepted, enabled him to study some of the finest
specimens of painting.&nbsp; Here also he became conscious of his
particular excellence in landscape painting, at the height of
which branch he soon arrived.&nbsp; His reputation having become
now very great, he returned to England in 1755.&nbsp; Although
his abilities were esteemed, he was far from obtaining the
patronage which his extraordinary talents deserved, and it was
not until after his death that his works were duly
appreciated.&nbsp; After a long period of neglect, and insult,
caused by the mean jealousy of rivals, he died near Mold, in
1782, in the sixty-eighth year of his age.</p>
<p><i>William Worthington</i>, D.D., an eminent theological
writer, was born in Meirionethshire in 1703.&nbsp; He received
his education at the Grammar School, in Oswestry, and
Jesus&rsquo; College, Oxford, where he proceeded <a
name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 79</span>through his
degrees.&nbsp; Having taken orders, he obtained various
preferment from Dr. Hare, then bishop of St. Asaph, he was rector
of Hope, and Darowen, and had a prebendal stall in the Cathedral
of St. Asaph, and another in York, to which he was appointed by
Archbishop Drummond, whose chaplain he had been.&nbsp; Among the
variety of his works, the principal are an &ldquo;Essay on
Redemption,&rdquo; &ldquo;Evidences of Christianity,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Sermons on Boyle&rsquo;s Lectures.&rdquo;&nbsp; He died in
1778.</p>
<p><i>Sir John Wynn</i> of Gwydir, was born near Llanrwst, in the
year 1553.&nbsp; He was made a baronet on the creation of that
honour in 1615.&nbsp; He lived in retirement, and wrote a curious
and valuable work, entitled &ldquo;The History of the Gwydir
family,&rdquo; which was first printed in 1773, octavo.&nbsp; He
was a member of the council of the marches, and was well versed
in the history and antiquities of his native country, and a great
patron of its literature.&nbsp; Inigo Jones was born on his
estate, and enjoyed the patronage of the family who first brought
him to notice.&nbsp; He died in 1626, in the seventy-third year
of his age.</p>
<p><i>John Wynne</i>, was born at Caerwys, Flintshire, and was
educated for some time at Northop School, from whence he removed
to Ruthin, and received his academical education at Jesus&rsquo;
College, Oxford, where <a name="page80"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 80</span>he obtained a fellowship.&nbsp; He
became rector of Llangelynin, in Caernarvonshire, and prebendary
of Brecon.&nbsp; He was appointed also the Lady Margaret&rsquo;s
professor of divinity, and by virtue of that, he had a prebend in
Worcester Cathedral in 1705.&nbsp; He was elected principal of
Jesus&rsquo; College in 1712, and was advanced to the bishopric
of St. Asaph in 1714.&nbsp; He was a very learned divine, and
extremely liberal in the repairing of his cathedral, which had
suffered great damage by a violent storm soon after his
appointment.&nbsp; He was translated to the diocese of Bath and
Wells in 1727, and died in July, 1743.</p>
<p><i>John Huddleston Wynne</i>, an eminent writer on
miscellaneous subjects, was born of a respectable family in Wales
in 1743.&nbsp; He was brought up to the profession of a printer,
which he followed for some time in London; he afterwards obtained
a commission in the army, which he quitted and commenced
author.&nbsp; His principal works are &ldquo;A General History of
the British Empire in America,&rdquo; and &ldquo;A History of
Ireland.&rdquo;&nbsp; He died in 1788.&nbsp; His uncle,</p>
<p><i>Richard Wynne</i>, M.A., of All Soul&rsquo;s College,
Oxford, was rector of St. Alphage, London, and of Ayot St.
Lawrence, in Hertfordshire.&nbsp; He published the New Testament
in English, carefully collated with the Greek, two volumes,
octavo.&nbsp; He died in 1799.</p>
<p><a name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
81</span><i>Philip Yorke</i>, an eminent antiquarian, and author
of a learned work entitled &ldquo;The Royal Tribes of
Wales,&rdquo; was born at Erddig, near Wrexham, in Denbighshire,
in 1743.&nbsp; After a liberal education, he was entered at Benet
College, Cambridge, where he graduated M.A.&nbsp; He represented
successively in parliament the boroughs of Halston and
Grantham.&nbsp; He died in 1804.</p>

<p><i>John Bradford</i>, an ingenious poet, who was admitted a
disciple of the bardic chair of Glamorgan, in 1730, being then a
boy; presided in the same chair 1760, and died in 1780.&nbsp; He
wrote several moral pieces of great merit, some of which he
printed in the &ldquo;Eurgrawn,&rdquo; a magazine then carried on
in South Wales.</p>
<p><i>Rev. Thomas Charles</i>, A.B., the son of a respectable
farmer, in the parish of Llanvihangel, South Wales, was born
October 14, 1755.&nbsp; When he was about ten or twelve years of
age, his parents entertaining thoughts of bringing him up to the
ministry, sent him to school at Llanddowror, about two miles off,
where he continued three or four years.&nbsp; When about fourteen
years of age, his father sent him to the academy, at Caermarthen,
which he left for Oxford in 1775, where he remained about four
years.&nbsp; On leaving Oxford, he was engaged to a curacy in
Somersetshire, which he <a name="page83"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 83</span>gave up in 1783, and removed to
Wales, after a ministry of five years.&nbsp; After Mr. Charles
returned to Wales, he was engaged successively to serve several
churches in the neighbourhood of Bala (where he then resided), at
each of which, his evangelical preaching giving great offence to
the inhabitants, his services were declined.&nbsp; Mr. Charles
having been so many times deprived of the opportunity of
exercising his ministry felt no small perplexity of mind: his
active disposition would not allow him to remain wholly
unoccupied.&nbsp; The ignorance which prevailed among the people
at Bala excited his sympathy; he invited them to his house to
give them religious instruction.&nbsp; He was offered the use of
the chapel by the Calvinistic Methodists, who were then, and for
some time after, connected with the Established Church: this
offer he accepted, and there he instructed and catechised the
numerous children who attended.&nbsp; In the year 1785, Mr.
Charles commenced preaching among the Methodists, from which
period to the time of his death his ministerial labours were very
great; the effect of which are still to be seen, and will
probably continue to appear for ages to come.&nbsp; Shortly after
Mr. Charles left the church, he began establishing circulating
schools; they succeeded wonderfully, the whole country being
filled with them.&nbsp; The fruits of these schools were numerous
Sunday schools throughout the Principality.&nbsp; <a
name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 84</span>Mr. Charles
prepared two editions of the Welsh Bible, one in duodecimo,
published in 1806, and another in octavo, completed just before
his death.&nbsp; But his greatest effort as an author was a
&ldquo;Scriptural Dictionary,&rdquo; four volumes, octavo.&nbsp;
Mr. Charles was the principal instrument in originating the Bible
Society; the exciting or moving cause of this noble institution
was the great want of Bibles, especially in North Wales.&nbsp; He
died October 5, 1814, in the fifty-ninth year of his age.</p>
<p><i>Robert Davies</i>, better known by the appellation of Bardd
Nantglyn, was born about the year 1769.&nbsp; At an early period
of his life he became a votary of the Awen, which propensity was
strengthened by his intimacy with Twm o&rsquo;r Nant, who always
expressed a just tribute of admiration for his poetical
efforts.&nbsp; In the year 1800 he removed to London, and there
became acquainted with those patriotic fosterers of their native
language and customs, who instituted the Gwyneddigion Society,
and he filled at intervals the situation of their bard and
secretary.&nbsp; The illness of his family compelled him
reluctantly to leave the metropolis, after a residence of about
four years, and return to Nantglyn, which he never afterwards
quitted.&nbsp; This occurrence, which was unforeseen, obliged him
to borrow a sum of money from Owain Myvyr, to defray the expenses
of removal, and shortly after he <a name="page85"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 85</span>was given to understand by that
generous character, that the loan should be a gift; and this
munificent donation enabled him to build a decent cottage, which
formed his domicile during his life.&nbsp; When the premiums
awarded by the Eisteddvodau stimulated the bards to unwonted
exertions, Robert Davies early distinguished himself, and
acquired the honour of occupying the bardic chair for Powys, at
the meeting held at Wrexham, in 1820, by his prize elegy on the
death of George the Third.&nbsp; The number of medals he acquired
on different occasions amounted to eleven; and in addition he
received, on various occasions, many money premiums for
meritorious exertions.&nbsp; It would be needless to recapitulate
the various subjects on which he was a successful competitor, as
the prize poems of his composition are mostly published in his
publication entitled &ldquo;Diliau Barddas,&rdquo; which contains
the greater part of the productions of his muse.&nbsp; He
likewise was the compiler of a very excellent
&ldquo;Grammar,&rdquo; in great esteem in the principality.&nbsp;
He died on 1st December, 1835, and was buried at Nantglyn, where
it is in contemplation to erect a tablet to his memory.</p>
<p><i>John Evans</i>, an adventurous young man of
Caernarvonshire, who, about the year 1790, went to America, with
a view of discovering the Welsh Indians, or descendants of Madog
and his followers.&nbsp; After <a name="page86"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 86</span>surmounting many difficulties, and
penetrating about 1,300 miles up the Missouri River, he was
obliged to return to St. Louis, on the Mississippi.&nbsp; The
commandant there encouraged him to try another voyage, with
attendants and everything necessary to make discoveries; but
unfortunately, John Evans died of a fever there in 1797, when
everything was prepared to ensure success to his enterprise.</p>
<p><i>Wyn Elis</i>, A.M., an eminent divine and poet, who lived
at Y-Las-Ynys, in Meirionethshire, from about the year 1680 to
1740.&nbsp; About the year 1720, he published a small tract in
Welsh of great utility, containing letters of advice to Christian
professors, with various hymns and other pieces.&nbsp; Soon
after, he published the &ldquo;Bardd Cwsg, or the Vision of the
Sleeping Bard,&rdquo; in the manner of Don Quivedo, a very
popular work, which has been reprinted several times since the
death of the author.</p>
<p><i>Rev. Evan Edward</i>, Aberdare, Glamorgan, an eminent
Dissenting preacher, philosopher and poet, and one of the few who
being initiated into the bardic mysteries, have helped to
preserve the institution to the present time.&nbsp; He died on
the 21st of June, 1798, being the time fixed for him to meet the
other bards of the chair of Glamorgan.</p>
<p><i>Sir John Glynne</i>, an able political lawyer in the time
of Charles the First, and during the Interregnum, <a
name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>was born in
the year 1590.&nbsp; He received his academic education at Hart
Hall, Oxford, and afterwards studied at Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn,
where he became a bencher.&nbsp; His talents were quickly
discovered by the popular party, and through the tide of
opposition, he was buoyed up above the common level.&nbsp; He
became steward of Westminster, was returned for two parliaments
that sat in the year 1640; was made recorder of London, and at
length lord chief justice of the upper bench.&nbsp; Cromwell made
him one of his council, and placed him on the committee appointed
to inquire into the title most proper for the usurper to
assume.&nbsp; He continued in office till the Restoration, when
he prudently and promptly determined to submit to the new
government.&nbsp; After having been one of the ablest supporters
of the protectorate, he was received by the reinstated King with
the most distinguished attention, and obtained honorary marks of
royal favour, for he was appointed prime serjeant, himself
knighted, and his eldest son created a baronet.&nbsp; He appears
to have been of considerable service, by sitting in the
convention parliament, as a representative for Caernarvon;
assisted by his advice to obtain the act of general amnesty; and
particularly in his judicial capacity, establishing the first
precedent of granting a rule for new trial in cases where
excessive damages had been awarded by the partial, or
inconsiderate verdicts of a jury.&nbsp; He died in the year
1666.</p>
<p><a name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
88</span><i>Doctor Gabriel Goodman</i> was a native of Ruthin,
distinguished for his various learning, but especially eminent as
a linguist and divine.&nbsp; He was promoted by Queen Elizabeth
to the deanery of Westminster; and, with other distinguished
characters, appointed an assistant in that great work, a version
of the Holy Scriptures.&nbsp; By his translation of his
&ldquo;First Epistle to the Corinthians,&rdquo; wholly performed
by him as well as other parts assigned him, he acquired great
fame; yet he obtained no higher preferment, dying dean of
Westminster after forty years&rsquo; incumbency, in the year
1601.&nbsp; His regard for learned men was great, as appears from
his having helped to support Camden in his travels, who, through
the dean&rsquo;s interest, was made under master of Westminster
School.&nbsp; His desire for perpetuating learning was no less
conspicuous in the free-school founded in his native place, and
his philanthropy still lives in an hospital established for the
aged poor.</p>
<p><i>Howell Harris</i>, an eminent preacher, distinguished as
the introducer of Methodism into Wales, was born at Trevecca, in
Brecknockshire, on January 23rd, 1713; and being designed for the
church, was admitted a student of St. Mary&rsquo;s Hall, Oxford,
in November, 1735.&nbsp; Here, however, he remained only during
one term, at the expiration of which, he quitted the University,
with the design of entering immediately on the duties of the
clerical profession.&nbsp; He had by this <a
name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 89</span>time,
apparently, imbibed the tenets and spirit of Whitfield, and
determined to propagate the doctrine of Methodism; with this view
he applied for orders, but was refused.&nbsp; Having commenced
his ministerial career, he came to his native place, and exerted
himself with great zeal and earnestness.&nbsp; His style of
preaching was much the same as that practised by the ministers of
his connection, particularly among the Welsh, who have probably
taken him for their model; it was bold, declamatory, and
animated, to a degree that might often be denominated
vociferation.&nbsp; At a period when religious freedom was but
imperfectly understood, even by those who deprecated persecution,
a man of Mr. Harris&rsquo;s active zeal for proselytism, was not
likely to pass unobserved.&nbsp; He was in some instances
prosecuted, but more frequently persecuted: his undaunted
resolution, however, triumphed over every opposition, and
rendered impotent every attempt to reduce him to silence.&nbsp;
He married in the year 1730, Anne, the daughter of John Williams,
Esq., of Screene, by whom he had one daughter.&nbsp; In the year
1756, when some apprehensions of an invasion were entertained, he
made a voluntary offer to furnish at his own expense, ten
light-horsemen completely armed and accoutred, which proposal was
accepted.&nbsp; Three years afterward, A.D. 1759, Mr. Harris
himself, embarked in a military character.&nbsp; He was first
appointed to an ensigncy in <a name="page90"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 90</span>the county militia, and afterwards
invested with the command of a company, in which were enrolled
many of his own followers.&nbsp; In the latter part of his life,
he derived much support from Lady Huntingdon, the warm patroness
of the Calvinistic Methodists, who came to reside in the
neighbourhood.&nbsp; Mr. Harris died at Trevecca, July 28, 1773,
and was buried in Talgarth church.&nbsp; In the year 1752 he
formed the plan of a religious community, something similar in
its constitution to the Moravian societies; and in the same year
he laid the foundation of Trevecca house, with a sufficient
extent of buildings and garden, and other ground to accommodate a
large number of inhabitants.&nbsp; Here he invited his disciples
to assemble, and to invest their property in a common fund, of
which all members, as occasion might require, were equally to
participate.</p>
<p><i>Morus Huw</i> of Perthi Llwydion, near Cerrig-y-Druidion,
Denbighshire, a distinguished poet, who flourished from about the
year 1600 to 1650.&nbsp; He is generally considered to be the
best song writer that has appeared in Wales.&nbsp; Many of his
compositions are in the Blodeugerdd.</p>
<p><i>Thomas Jones</i>, bardd cloff (the lame bard).&nbsp; This
highly respectable bard was born at Mynydd Bychan (the little
mountain), in the parish of Llantysilio, Denbighshire, April 15,
1768.&nbsp; When quite an infant, he met with an accident which
lamed him for <a name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
91</span>life&mdash;hence the appellation of the lame bard.&nbsp;
In 1775 Mr. Jones&rsquo;s family removed to Llangollen, and
Thomas was sent to the best school in the town; in 1782 the
family removed again to Machynlleth, in the county of
Montgomery.&nbsp; In 1780, Mathew Davies, Esq., brought young
Jones to London, and placed him in his counting-house, in Long
Acre, where Mr. Davies carried on a very large establishment in
the coach and military-lace line.&nbsp; Mr Jones was exceedingly
fond of reading, particularly poetry; and about this time he
began &ldquo;to torment the Awen&rdquo; (Muse), as he used to
say; and wrote several things both in Welsh and English.&nbsp; In
1789 he was elected a member of the Gwyneddigion, and shortly
afterwards he became secretary to the society.&nbsp; At the time
when it was regularly attended by Owain Jones, Myfyr, Dr. W. O.
Pughe, &amp;c., who encouraged the young bard, and gave him much
valuable advice.&nbsp; In 1794 we find his name as one of the
stewards of the festival of Ancient Britons, and in 1801, as
llywydd (chairman) of the Gwyneddigion.&nbsp; In 1802 he
published &ldquo;An Ode of St. David&rsquo;s-day,&rdquo; and the
following year Mr. Davies made him the head manager of his
business; a convincing proof of the rectitude of his conduct,
which was farther testified by his becoming a partner in
1813.&nbsp; The Metropolitan Cambrian Institution, founded on the
basis of the Cymrodorion (established in 1750) was revived, and
Mr. <a name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 92</span>Jones
was elected treasurer; and he gained the gold medal offered by
the society for the best poem in the Welsh language, on its
revival.&nbsp; In 1821 he was president of the Gwyneddigion for
the third time; and at the jubilee anniversary dinner, he was
presented with the society&rsquo;s silver medal, to commemorate
the event.&nbsp; Mr. Jones gained several prizes at the different
Eisteddvodau held in Wales.&nbsp; And, after residing for a
period of forty-five years (with little intermission) at No. 90,
Long Acre, departed this life February 18, 1828, esteemed and
lamented by all who knew him.&nbsp; Mr. Jones was an
open-hearted, generous, hospitable, benevolent man; no indigent
countryman appealed to him in vain; his name was invariably found
in every list of subscription raised for the promotion of
literature, or the relief of distress.&nbsp; Y bardd cloff, was,
like his equally generous countryman and friend, Mr. David Jones,
of the House of Commons, universally known by the Cymry, both in
London and the principality.&nbsp; And when he was gathered to
his fathers, the Cymrodorion offered its silver medal for the
best approved of marwnad (elegy) on his lamented demise, which
was awarded to Robert Davies, bardd nantglyn.</p>
<p><i>John Jones</i> of Celli Lyvdy, distinguished as one of the
most indefatigable collectors of Welsh literature that have
appeared among us.&nbsp; He continued translating old Welsh
manuscripts for a period of forty years, as it <a
name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 93</span>appears from
some of his volumes, which are dated variously from the year 1590
to 1630; and of whose works in this way upwards of forty large
volumes still exist.</p>
<p><i>Edward Jones</i> was born at a farm in Meirionethshire,
called Henblas, or Old Mansion, on Easter Sunday, in the year
1752.&nbsp; His father was what is generally termed a musical
genius: he could not only perform on various instruments, but he
also made several.&nbsp; He taught two of his sons, Edward and
Thomas, the Welsh harp, another son the spinnet, and another the
violin, and he played himself on the organ&mdash;so that the
&ldquo;Family Concert&rdquo; was at least a tolerable strong
one.&nbsp; Edward Jones came to London about the year 1774, under
the patronage of several persons of distinction, connected with
the principality.&nbsp; His performance on the harp was
considered in those days, when taste, feeling, and expression,
were the characteristic features of a lyrist, to be very
superior.&nbsp; He met with great encouragement, and had the
honour of giving instructions to many ladies of rank.&nbsp; He
was appointed Bard to the Prince of Wales in 1783, but it was
merely an honorary situation.</p>
<p>In conjunction with Dr. Owen Pughe, Mr. Walters, and a few
literary friends, he published a volume of Ancient Bardic Lore,
and Welsh Airs, in 1794, and, in four years afterwards, brought
out a second volume.&nbsp; In 1820 he published the first part of
a third volume, <a name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
94</span>and had employed his days chiefly since in preparing the
remainder, so as to complete the work; but he was not permitted
to accomplish it.&nbsp; He had been severely afflicted with
rheumatic pains for some time, and his memory became daily more
defective; he was a very reserved man, and passed most of his
time alone, with his chamber door locked.</p>
<p>He had been a collector of scarce books, and possessed many
valuable ones; but his inability to follow his professional
pursuits, and his high spirit preventing him from making his
situation known to his relatives, caused him to dispose of a part
of his library, on the produce of which he subsisted.</p>
<p>Several friends saw that he was daily becoming an object of
their friendly attention, who endeavoured to ascertain his
circumstances; but from him they could learn nothing,
notwithstanding it was pretty certain that he passed many days
without a dinner.</p>
<p>It became at length a duty incumbent on them to take him under
their care; a recommendation to the Governors of the Royal
Society of Musicians was promptly attended to, and an annuity of
50<i>l.</i> was granted unknown to him.&nbsp; This single act of
benevolence speaks volumes in favour of that excellent
institution, which was founded in 1738, with a view of shielding
the &ldquo;child of song,&rdquo; in the decline of life, from
penury and want; also to provide for the widows and orphans of <a
name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 95</span>its indigent
members, at their decease.&nbsp; Mr. Jones entered the society in
1778.</p>
<p>Mr. Parry was deputed to give him the first monthly
payment.&nbsp; It was in the evening when he called; he found the
Bard locked in his room, at his lodgings in Great
Chesterfield-street, Marylebone, and was admitted: he did not
recollect Mr. Parry immediately, although most intimately
acquainted with him; he had his dressing-gown and night-cap on,
his harp standing by the table, on which was a blotted sheet of
music paper.&nbsp; Mr. Parry told him the purport of the visit,
but he did not pay much attention to it, and only asked, with
much fervency, whether he knew &ldquo;The Melody of Mona,&rdquo;
(See Relicks, vol. i. p. 168,) a most beautiful pathetic Welsh
air, in the minor key, to which Mrs. Hemans has written an
excellent song, called &ldquo;The Lament of the last
Druid.&rdquo;&nbsp; He took his harp, and with a trembling
hand,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Struck the deep sorrows of his
Lyre.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was impossible not to feel affected on such an
occasion&mdash;the scene reminded him of the dying hour of a
celebrated Bard, who called for his harp, and performed a most
plaintive strain&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Sweet solace of my dying hour,<br />
Ere yet my arm forget its power,<br />
Give to my falt&rsquo;ring hand, my shell,<br />
One strain to bid the world farewell.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a few days afterwards he fell in a fit; the landlady <a
name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 96</span>who sat in
the apartment below, heard a noise; she ran up, but could not
gain admission; the door was burst open, when the poor Bard was
found lying on his face, with a heavy chair on his back.&nbsp; He
remained senseless for two days, and expired without a groan on
Easter Sunday, April 18, 1824, aged 72.&nbsp; He was conveyed to
his silent tomb, in St. Mary-le-bone burial-ground, on the
following Sunday.&nbsp; Mr. Jones left a number of scarce books,
and much music, which were disposed of by public auction in
February, 1825, and produced nearly 500<i>l.</i>&nbsp; He had, at
various times previous to his death, sold books and prints to the
amount of about 300<i>l.</i>, so that his whole collection may be
stated at 800<i>l.</i>; an extraordinary sum, considering the
habits of the collector!&nbsp; Of his professional abilities, his
&ldquo;Relicks of the Welsh Bards&rdquo; bear ample testimony;
and will convey his name, with honour, to posterity.&nbsp; They
are the result of forty years labour and research; and his
countrymen of the Principality may now boast, that, as well as
the Irish and the Scotch, they also have their
&ldquo;Melodies.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Rice Jones</i> of Blaenau, in Meirionethshire, one of the
most eminent poets of Wales of recent times.&nbsp; He died in the
autumn of the year 1801, at the great age eighty-six.&nbsp; In
the year 1770 he published a &ldquo;Welsh Anthology,&rdquo; in
quarto, containing choice selections from the poets of different
ages.</p>
<p><a name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
97</span><i>Theophilus Jones</i>, the ingenious and learned
author of the &ldquo;History of Brecknockshire,&rdquo; was born
Oct. 18, 1758.&nbsp; He was the son of the Rev. Hugh Jones,
successively vicar of the parishes of Langammarch and Llywel,
Brecknockshire, and a prebendary of the collegiate church of
Brecknock.&nbsp; With his grandfather, Mr. Theophilus Evans, Mr.
Jones passed much of his early life.&nbsp; His principal
education was completed in the college school at Brecknock.&nbsp;
Being destined by his parents to the law, Mr. Jones, at a proper
age, was placed under the care of an eminent practitioner then
resident in the town of Brecknock; and after having passed with
credit the period of his probation, entered into the profession
upon his own account, and continued in it for many years,
practising with equal reputation and success as an attorney and
solicitor in that place.&nbsp; Upon a vacancy in the deputy
registrarship of the archdeaconry of Brecknock, he was appointed
to that office, and held it till his death.&nbsp; From the
documents committed to his charge, and to which he was
particularly attentive, he derived much valuable information
connected with the parochial history of the county.&nbsp; After
Mr. Jones commenced the history of his county, finding that the
duties of his profession could not be attended to, and
antiquarian pursuits followed at the same time, he disposed of
the attorney&rsquo;s and solicitor&rsquo;s business.&nbsp; Being
now more <a name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
98</span>at liberty to pursue the great object of his ambition,
he spared neither pains nor expense to carry it into
execution.&nbsp; There was no part of the county into which he
did not extend his personal researches, inquiring most minutely
into the natural history and antiquities of every place and
parish.&nbsp; The first volume of his history of Brecknockshire
in quarto, was published at Brecknock in the year 1805, and the
second volume in 1809.&nbsp; With the exception of two
communications to periodical publications, and two papers in the
Cambrian Register, this was his only literary production.&nbsp;
It was his intention to publish a history of Radnorshire, but his
enfeebled state of health would not allow him to make the
necessary exertions.&nbsp; His last literary attempt was a
translation of that well written Welsh romance, entitled
&ldquo;Gweledigaethau y Bardd Cwsg,&rdquo; or Visions of the
Sleeping Bard, by the Rev. Ellis Wynne.&nbsp; He died upon the
15th of January, 1812, and was buried in the parish church of
Llangammarth.</p>
<p><i>David Jones</i> of Trevriw, in Caernarvonshire, a poet who
flourished from about the year 1750 to 1780.&nbsp; He edited two
collections of Welsh poetry, one called &ldquo;Diddanwch
Teuluaidd,&rdquo; and the other &ldquo;Dewisol
Ganiadau.&rdquo;&nbsp; He also formed a large collection of old
manuscripts, which have been lately purchased from his sons by
the Rev. H. D. Griffith, of Caer Rhun, <a name="page99"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 99</span>and appropriated by that gentleman
for the enriching of the Welsh Archaiology.</p>
<p><i>Richard Llwyd</i>, generally known in North Wales as the
Bard of Snowden, and Author of &ldquo;Beaumaris Bay,&rdquo; two
volumes of poems, &amp;c., was born at Beaumaris, in the Isle of
Anglesea, in 1752, and terminated a life devoted to the interest
and literature of his country, on the 29th December, 1834, at his
residence in Bank-place, Chester.&nbsp; The morning of his days
was clouded with adversity.&nbsp; While yet a child, his father,
who traded on the coast in a small vessel of his own, was
shipwrecked, and lost at once his vessel, his cargo, and his
life!&mdash;a calamity which plunged his surviving family in
hopeless poverty and distress.&nbsp; The extreme poverty of his
mother precluded her from giving Richard any education.&nbsp;
Nevertheless, in early life his propensities for knowledge
discovered itself in a variety of ways, and in spite of the
obstacles with which he was surrounded, gave an early promise of
the brightness and ardour of his genius, and that greatness of
character in which he afterwards so eminently distinguished
himself.&nbsp; There was, fortunately for him, at Beaumaris, a
free-school, founded by Mr. David Hughes, a man born, like
himself, in the vale of humility, but who afterwards became a
blessing to his native island.&nbsp; Hence he says in one of his
notes to &ldquo;Gayton Wake,&rdquo; I received an education of
nine <a name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
100</span>months, and I acknowledge this blessing with humble
gratitude as it has been to me an inexhaustible source of
happiness.&nbsp; At twelve years old, his mother gladly accepted
a situation for him in the service of Henry Morgan, Esq., of
Henblas.&nbsp; Here he remained several years, and here it was
that his character was formed; he had not many opportunities of
gratifying his insatiable thirst for reading, but such as he had
he availed himself of, with unremitting zeal and ardour.&nbsp; He
always rose at a very early hour, and devoted the time he thus
gained to reading and studying.&nbsp; In temperance and frugality
he was remarkable through life, and always studied and practised
it with the utmost exactness, which gave him a constant feeling
of dignified independence.&nbsp; In the year 1780 Mr. Lloyd
entered into the service of Mr. Griffith, of Caer Rh&ucirc;n,
near Conway, as superintendent of a large demesne and
family.&nbsp; Mr. Griffith being in the commission of the peace,
and the only acting magistrate in an extensive district, Llwyd
acted as his clerk; this situation offered him an opportunity of
pursuing his favourite studies.&nbsp; Here he lived until Mr.
Griffith died, and with what he had saved, aided by bequeaths
from two friends, he retired from the world.&nbsp; In 1797 he
published his poem of &ldquo;Beaumaris Bay,&rdquo; which was
extremely well received by the public, and materially added to
his pecuniary resources.&nbsp; Mr. Llwyd had <a
name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
101</span>successfully studied the antiquities of his country,
and was exceedingly well versed in heraldry, which added to his
native vivacity, wit, and good humour, made his company courted
by the first families in the principality, at whose mansions he
was always a welcome guest.&nbsp; In 1804 Mr. Llwyd published his
&ldquo;Gayton Wake,&rdquo; and two volumes of poems,
&ldquo;Tales, Ode,&rdquo; &amp;c., translated from the British,
which show the extent and variety of his genius, and which met
with extensive encouragement.&nbsp; In 1814 he married Miss
Bingley, daughter of the late Alderman Bingley, of the city of
Chester, with whom he lived happily in comfortable independence,
and whom he survived about twelve months.</p>
<p><i>William Maurice</i> of Cevyn-y-Briach, in Denbighshire, a
distinguished antiquary and the assistant of Mr. Robert Vaughan,
of Hengwrt, in collecting old Welsh manuscripts.&nbsp; The
collection made by Mr. Maurice is now preserved at
Wynnestay.&nbsp; He died about the year 1660.</p>
<p><i>William Middleton</i>, sometimes called in Welsh, Gwilym
Ganoldrev, an eminent poet and grammarian of the family of
Gwenynog, in Denbighshire, who lived from the year 1560 to
1600.&nbsp; He served in the armies of Elizabeth, and was
afterwards a captain of a ship of war; and, it is worthy of
notice, that the principal work that he left behind him was done
at sea, <a name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
102</span>being an elegant &ldquo;Version of the Psalms,&rdquo;
in the higher kind of Welsh metre.&nbsp; This work we find, from
a note at the end of it, was finished January 24th, 1595, in the
West Indies, and was printed after his death by Thomas Salusbury
in 1603.&nbsp; The only other performance of this author which
has been printed is his &ldquo;Grammar,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Art of
Poetry,&rdquo; which he published in the year 1593.</p>
<p><i>Richard Morris</i>, a brother of Lewis Morris, of Penros
Llugwy, Anglesea, an ingenious Welsh critic and poet.&nbsp; He
passed the greater part of his life as first clerk in the
Navy-office; during which, he superintended the printing of two
valuable editions of the Welsh Bible.&nbsp; He died in the year
1779.</p>
<p><i>Paul Panton</i>, Esq., of Plas Gwyn, in Anglesea, a
character distinguished for his acquaintance with the history and
antiquities of his native country, and who left behind him a
valuable collection of Welsh manuscripts; but who was more
conspicuous for his liberality in aiding others, who pursued a
similar track with himself.&nbsp; In addition to his own
collection of papers, he also became possessed of the books of
the Rev. Evan Evans, author of the Desertatio de Bardis, and
other things, in consequence of having settled an annuity of
&pound;20. on that child of misfortune, towards the close of his
life.&nbsp; Mr. Panton died in 1797, in the sixty-seventh year of
his age.</p>
<p><a name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
103</span><i>William Parry</i>, some time president and
theological tutor at Wymondley Academy, Herts, was born in the
year 1754, at Abergavenny, in Monmouthshire.&nbsp; When he was
about seven years of age, he removed with his father to London,
where he attended the ministry of Dr. Samuel Stennett.&nbsp; At
the age of twenty, he was introduced to the Academy of Homerton,
where Mr. Parry remained during six years, pursuing with
unremitting ardour, the studies to which he had devoted
himself.&nbsp; On leaving the academy, he acceded to an
invitation from the church of Little Baddow, Essex, where he was
ordained in the year 1780.&nbsp; In the year 1798 proposals were
made to Mr. Parry by the trustees of W. Coward, Esq., to become
theological tutor in the Dissenting Academy which had for some
years been conducted at Northampton and Daventry, by Doctors
Doddridge and Ashworth.&nbsp; An earnest desire of extended
usefulness led Mr. Parry to accept those proposals; and in the
year 1799 he took an affectionate farewell of his beloved flock
at Baddow, after having laboured amongst them for twenty years,
with great acceptance and fidelity.&nbsp; Mr. Parry entered on
his new and important office at Wymondley (to which place the
academy was removed).&nbsp; In undertaking the office of tutor,
Mr. Parry did not resign that of a minister of Christ:
immediately after his settlement at Wymondley, a small chapel was
erected on the premises, where a <a name="page104"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 104</span>congregation was raised, and a
church formed, over which he presided as pastor till the time of
his decease.&nbsp; With the exception of a charge delivered at
the ordination of one of his students, Mr. Parry appeared but
once in the character of an author.&nbsp; He died in the year
1818, in the sixty-fourth year of his age.</p>
<p><i>William Owen Pughe</i>, D.C.L., was born at Ty&rsquo;n y
Bryn, in the parish of Llanvihangel y Pennant, county of
Meirioneth, on the 7th of August, 1759.&nbsp; A man who is, by
universal consent, pronounced the greatest literary character
which old Cambria has ever produced at any period of time; and
this may be truly said, without detracting from the unfading
renown of our Taliesins, Aneurins, Gwalchmais, Cynddelws, Hywel
Ddas, Goronwy Owens, or any other Cambrian author, because they
did not exercise their talents, however great, in so varied and
rich a field, or so extensive and bright a sphere as Dr. Owen
Pughe.&nbsp; The family removed to Egryn, in Ardudwy, a short
period after his birth, and there he passed his youthful days
until he was sent to school at Altringham, near Manchester; and
when arrived at seventeen years of age, he settled in
London.&nbsp; Here he became intimate with Owain Myvyr and
others, members of the Gwyneddigion; and projected and commenced
his great work, the &ldquo;Welsh and English
Dictionary.&rdquo;&nbsp; He laboured, at intervals, upon this
arduous undertaking for the <a name="page105"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 105</span>space of eighteen years, during
which he read all the remains of antiquity which could be
procured to furnish materials to incorporate in this thesaurus of
the words of the Welsh language.&nbsp; In conjunction with Owain
Myvyr and Iolo Morganwg he became engaged in a work, which must
elicit the warmest thanks of all Welsh scholars, intended to
perpetuate, for the benefit of posterity, the existing documents
of the Cymry to the close of the thirteenth century.&nbsp; This
splendid memorial of patriotism and industry is entitled the
Myvyrian Archaiology of Wales, and has afforded a facility for
the study of British Antiquities, which will place this
department of the history of our island on a sure basis.&nbsp;
The Cambrian Biography, the translation of the works of
Llywarchhen, and an agricultural treatise for Mr. Johnes, of
Havod, the superintendence of the Cambrian Register, the Greal,
the edition of the poems of Davydd ap Gwilym, and numerous
important communications to such works as Rees&rsquo;
Encyclop&aelig;dia, Warrington&rsquo;s History of Wales,
Hoare&rsquo;s History of Wiltshire, Britton&rsquo;s Beauties of
England and Wales, Campbell&rsquo;s Books on Wales, Gunn&rsquo;s
Tracts, Meyrick&rsquo;s Cardiganshire, Cox&rsquo;s Publications,
Chalmer&rsquo;s Caledonia, were the fruit of his studies and
indefatigable perseverance at this period.&nbsp; In the year
1806, an estate in Wales devolved to him, where, after intervals
spent in London, he finally <a name="page106"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 106</span>settled.&nbsp; During this
retirement he translated &ldquo;Milton&rsquo;s Paradise
Lost,&rdquo; &ldquo;Heber&rsquo;s Palestine,&rdquo; many of Mrs.
Heman&rsquo;s poetical pieces, &amp;c., into Welsh, and the
&ldquo;Mabinagion,&rdquo; &amp;c., into English, besides many
original productions of great merit.&nbsp; The University of
Oxford, as a testimony of estimation for his arduous and useful
labours, conferred on him the degree of D.C.L.&nbsp; He breathed
his last at Dolydd y Cae, a house at the base of Cader Idris,
where he had spent a few days in the same tranquil manner as had
distinguished him through life, on the 4th of June, 1835; thus
closing a life useful to his country, and endeared to his family
and friends, at the foot of the same mountain which had witnessed
his birth.&nbsp; A subscription has been entered into for the
purpose of raising a fund to defray the expense of erecting a
monument to the memory of the erudite and amiable William Owen
Pughe.</p>
<p><i>Dr. David Powel</i>, an eminent antiquary of Denbighshire,
born about the year 1552, and educated at Oxford, where he took
his degree of D.D.&nbsp; He died in 1590, and was buried at
Rhiwabon, of which he was vicar.&nbsp; In 1584 he published an
English version of &ldquo;Caradog&rsquo;s Chronicle of
Wales,&rdquo; with annotations, and some other works.</p>
<p><i>Edward Richard</i>, an eminent Welsh critic, and an elegant
pastoral poet, who was a native of Ystrad Meirig, in
Cardiganshire.&nbsp; He was the master of a <a
name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 107</span>grammar
school in his native village, from about the year 1735 to the
time of his death, on the 4th March, 1777.</p>
<p><i>William Richards</i>, L.L.D., was born in the year 1749, in
the parish of Penrhydd, in the vicinity of Haverfordwest, county
of Pembroke, South Wales.&nbsp; Though the Bible was the
favourite theme of his studies, his reading was not confined to
it, he made himself acquainted with the best authors in the
English language; was well versed in civil and ecclesiastical
history, and deemed an admirable critic in the Cambro-British
tongue.&nbsp; Having determined to devote himself to the ministry
of the gospel, he placed himself in the Baptist Academy at
Bristol in the year 1773, where he continued two years.&nbsp; On
leaving the academy at Bristol, Mr. Richards accepted an
invitation to Pershore, in Worcestershire, where he became
assistant to Dr. John Ash, pastor of the Baptist church of that
place.&nbsp; In 1776 he accepted an invitation from the Baptist
church at Lynn, in Norfolk, to become their pastor, and arrived
there on the 1st of July.&nbsp; When Mr. Richards had been some
years at Lynn, he received an invitation to settle at Norwich,
but that he declined.&nbsp; After having passed forty-two years
among his people at Lynn, he died on the 13th of September, 1818,
in the sixty-ninth year of his age.&nbsp; His greatest effort as
an author, was the &ldquo;History of Lynn,&rdquo; in two large
octavo volumes, embellished with engravings.</p>
<p><a name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
108</span><i>Sir Richard Richards</i>, Lord Chief Baron, was born
in the year 1752.&nbsp; In the whole circle of the profession, no
man stood higher in private estimation, or public respect.&nbsp;
As a lawyer and a judge, his decisions, particularly in exchequer
cases, were sound, and evinced considerable acuteness.&nbsp; He
long enjoyed the friendship and confidence of Lord Chancellor
Eldon, for whom, on several occasions, he presided under special
commissions as speaker of the House of Lords.&nbsp; He was
appointed on the fourth of May, 1813, chief justice of Chester,
one of the barons of the exchequer in 1814, and in April, 1817,
on the death of Sir A. Thomson, Lord Chief Baron, Sir R. Richards
succeeded him in that high office.&nbsp; He died in London, on
the 11th of November, 1823.</p>
<p><i>Grufydd Roberts</i>, a learned grammarian, who was educated
at the University of Sienna, in Italy, under the patronage of
William Herbert, Earl of Pembroke.&nbsp; He printed his valuable
&ldquo;Welsh Grammar&rdquo; at Milan, in the year 1567.</p>
<p><i>Rev. Daniel Rowlands</i>, rector of Llangeitho, in
Cardiganshire, was born in the year 1713.&nbsp; He was a very
distinguished minister of the gospel, who, by the mighty power of
his extraordinary eloquence, roused some of his countrymen from
that lethargy into which the whole country had sunk as to
religion.&nbsp; His preaching was so valued, and such the
benefits derived from it, <a name="page109"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 109</span>that many flocked to hear him from
every part of the Principality.&nbsp; He continued rising in the
public esteem till his death, which happened on October 10,
1790.&nbsp; He was reputed among the Calvinistic Methodists; but
he taught particular tenets, and was the founder of a distinct
sect, now pretty numerous in Wales, and denominated Rowlandists
after his name.</p>
<p><i>David Samwell</i>, an elegant poet, who was a native of
Nantglyn, in Denbighshire.&nbsp; He was surgeon to the ship
Discovery, commanded by Captain Cook, and was an eye-witness of
the death of that celebrated navigator, of which melancholy event
he wrote a circumstantial account in the Biographia
Britannica.&nbsp; He died in the autumn of the year 1799.</p>
<p><i>Rhydderch Sion</i>, a poet and grammarian, who lived from
about the year 1700 to 1750.&nbsp; The latter part of his life he
passed as a printer at Shrewsbury, where he published his
&ldquo;Welsh Grammar,&rdquo; and a small &ldquo;Welsh
Vocabulary.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Trevredyn Sion</i>, an eminent divine among the
Nonconformists, who flourished as a theological writer from about
the year 1670 to 1720; and who published his opinions in a book,
which is an elegant specimen of the Silurian dialect.</p>
<p><i>Prys Thomas</i>, of Pl&acirc;s Iolyn, a distinguished poet
who lived from about the year 1560 to 1610.&nbsp; He was a
gentleman of an ancient family and large property in <a
name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
110</span>Denbighshire; who, being of a wild and roving
disposition, fitted out a privateer in which he went to try his
fortune against the Spaniards.&nbsp; It appears also from one of
his poems that he was an officer in the land service, and was at
Tilbury when Queen Elizabeth reviewed the array then assembled
there.</p>
<p><i>Davydd Edward o Vargam</i>, an eminent poet of Glamorgan,
who was admitted a graduate of the Gorfedd for that province in
the year 1620, presided there in 1660, and died in 1690.&nbsp;
Many of his productions are preserved, but his most important
work is the &ldquo;Augmentation of the Collection of the Bardic
Mysteries,&rdquo; formed by Llywelyn o Llangewydd.</p>
<p><i>Alderman Waithman</i> was, indeed, &ldquo;the architect of
his own fortune.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was born near Wrexham, North
Wales, in 1764, of parents of virtuous character, but in humble
life.&nbsp; His father died soon afterwards; and his mother
re-marrying, Waithman, when an infant, was adopted by an uncle, a
respectable linendraper, in Bath, and sent to the school of one
Moore, an ingenious man, the economy of whose plan of education
led all his pupils to acquire the habit of public and
extemporaneous speaking.&nbsp; Mr. Waithman was afterwards taken
into the business of his uncle; on whose death, about 1788, he
obtained a situation at Reading, whence he proceeded to London,
and lived with a respectable linendraper until he became of
age.&nbsp; He then married, <a name="page111"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 111</span>and opened a shop at the south end
of Fleet Market, nearly on the precise site of the monument there
erected to his memory.&nbsp; His activity and success next
enabled him to remove to more extensive premises, at the corner
of Bridge-street and Fleet-street, where he always honoured the
high character of a London citizen and tradesman.&nbsp; He
retired from his business about twelve years since.&nbsp; He
appears to have commenced his political career about the year
1794; when, at a Common Hall, he submitted a series of
resolutions upon the war with France, and enforcing the necessity
of a reform in parliament; which resolutions were triumphantly
carried, and laid the foundation of his popularity.&nbsp; He was
next elected into the Common Council, where the speeches,
resolutions, petitions and addresses, which he moved and carried,
would fill a considerable volume.&nbsp; His friends, and his own
well-directed ambition, next prompted him to seek to represent
the city of London in parliament; but his efforts were
unsuccessful, till, at the general election of 1818, he was
returned by a great majority, having polled 4,603 votes.&nbsp; He
next became alderman of his ward, Farringdon Without, the most
considerable in the city.&nbsp; At the general election, in 1820,
he lost his seat by 140 votes.&nbsp; In the same year he served
as Sheriff of London and Middlesex, with activity and
intelligence; as he filled the office of Lord Mayor in
1823&ndash;24.&nbsp; At the <a name="page112"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 112</span>elections of 1826, 1830, 1831, and
1833 he was again returned for the City.&nbsp; He died in
February, 1833, and was buried in St. Bride&rsquo;s church, Fleet
street.&nbsp; A glance at these few data of the Alderman&rsquo;s
useful life will bear out the proposition that he was &ldquo;the
architect of his own fortune.&rdquo;&nbsp; He owed nothing to
court, or even City patronage; but, even amidst the turmoil of a
political life, he accumulated a respectable fortune; for, it
should be remembered that he became an active politician forty
years since, or within ten years after he had established himself
in business.&nbsp; He was a man of unflinching integrity and
untiring industry&mdash;qualities which make their possessor rich
indeed.&nbsp; As an orator, he was characterized rather by
fluency than finery of language: he preferred common to fine
sense, and his experience in matters of the great stage of the
world was very considerable.</p>
<p><i>Edward Williams</i>, master of Rotherham Academy, was born
November the 14th, 1750, at Glancllwyd near Denbigh.&nbsp; The
rudiments of his education he received at various schools in the
neighbourhood, but having at the age of twenty, decided on
entering the Christian ministry, he was placed under private
tuition.&nbsp; If a few years time he was sent to prosecute his
studies at the Dissenting Academy of Abergavenny.&nbsp; His first
settlement in the ministry was at Ross, in Herefordshire, where
he was ordained in 1776.&nbsp; A few years after <a
name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 113</span>this, Mr.
Williams was requested to direct the concerns of the seminary at
Abergavenny, but as he declined that proposal, the academy was
removed from Abergavenny to Oswestry, where Mr. Williams now
commenced the delivery of a course of college lectures, which he
continued for about ten years, when he transferred the academy to
other hands, and removed to Birmingham in 1792.&nbsp; After
spending three years at the latter place, he received an
invitation to superintend the concerns of the Independent Academy
at Rotherham, in Yorkshire, to which station he removed in 1795,
and that station he continued to occupy to the period of his
death, March 9, 1813.&nbsp; A diploma from Edinburgh constituting
him Doctor of Divinity, was received in 1792.&nbsp; Among the
numerous productions of his pen are a reply to Mr. Abraham Booth
on the &ldquo;Baptismal Controversy,&rdquo; two volumes,
duodecimo, an &ldquo;Abridgement of Dr. Owen&rsquo;s Exposition
of the Epistle to the Hebrews,&rdquo; four volumes, octavo, an
&ldquo;Essay on the Equity of Divine Government, and the
Sovereignty of the Divine Grace.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Peter Williams</i>, A.M., an eminent divine among the
Calvinists in Wales, who died August 4th, 1796, in his
seventy-seventh year.&nbsp; He published a large quarto Welsh
Bible in 1770, with copious notes, which has gone through two
subsequent editions.&nbsp; He also printed a small edition with
notes, also a Concordance, and several religious tracts.</p>
<p><a name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
114</span><i>Rev. William Williams</i>, an eminent preacher among
the Methodists, and who was a poet of considerable genius.&nbsp;
He published a great many tracts, and Welsh hymns for the use of
his society; the principal of which is a work called &ldquo;Golwg
ar Deyrnas Crist,&rdquo; published in 1761.&nbsp; He died about
the year 1776.</p>
<p><i>Rev. Morris Williams</i>, a celebrated Welsh antiquary, was
born on the 2nd of March, 1685, in the parish of Cellan,
Cardiganshire, and was the son of the Rev. Samuel Williams, vicar
of Llandifriog.&nbsp; The elementary part of his classical
education he received at the Caermarthen Grammar-school, whence
he removed to Oxford, and matriculated at University College, May
31, 1705.&nbsp; Here he took his first degree in arts in 1708; he
was afterwards incorporated in the same degree at Cambridge, and
proceeded master of arts in that University in 1718.&nbsp; He was
ordained deacon by Dr. Fromnel, Bishop of Norwich, a priest by
Dr. Ottley, Bishop of St. David&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Dr. Ottley
presented him to the living of Llanwenog, in the above county, in
1715; and in 1717 he was inducted to the vicarage of Devynock, in
Brecknockshire, where, in 1718 he married Margaret Davies, of
that parish.&nbsp; In 1724 he exchanged this living for the
rectory of Chetton Trinity, and the vicarage of St. Mary&rsquo;s,
Bridgewater, Somersetshire.&nbsp; He was elected a fellow of the
Royal Society in 1732.&nbsp; His chief reputation as a Welsh
scholar and antiquary rests on the valuable <a
name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 115</span>assistance
he gave Dr. Wotton in preparing for publication his edition of
the Laws of Hywel Dda, the glossary to which, a very able and
learned performance, was principally compiled by Mr.
Williams.&nbsp; His other works comprise various theological
treatises, now little known.&nbsp; He also drew up a manuscript
catalogue of books in the Bodleian Library at Oxford, and a
manuscript life of himself, deposited in that library.&nbsp; His
books and manuscripts he bequeathed to Lord Macclesfield.</p>
<p><i>Cynwal Williams</i>, an eminent poet of Penmacno,
Caernarvonshire, who lived from about the year 1560 to
1600.&nbsp; The most interesting part of his works is his
poetical controversy with Edmund Prys, the archdeacon of
Meirionethshire; a contest that was carried on with so much
feeling as ultimately to cause Cynwal Williams to fall a martyr
to the poignancy of one of the replications of his
antagonist.</p>
<p><i>William Wyn</i>, A.M., an eminent poet and divine, of the
family of Rhaged, in Meirionethshire, who lived from about the
year 1740 to 1760, in which last year he died.&nbsp; He was the
rector of Llangyhaval and Manavon, in Denbighshire.&nbsp; Some
beautiful compositions by him are printed in Dewisol
Ganiadau.</p>

collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
